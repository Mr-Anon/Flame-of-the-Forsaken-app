        <p><strong>I</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">f dread and misery could be represented in a scene, the Ottaral mines would be an appropriate description. Here the chained slaves, each having a pickaxe in hand were busy prying open the walls rich in iron. Their work was hastened at the peril of the soldiers standing behind them, each having a whip in hand in case they decided someone&rsquo;s speed was not enough. The scene was made more grim by the fact that there was no sky here but only rocks in every direction, with a small clearing in the middle.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For two months, Felisin had been working in this hellsworn place. She would be brought here in the morning just an hour after dawn and would mine until dusk. The beginning had been pretty tough on her. Coming from a noble family and having never performed manual labour in her entire life, she found herself to be having far less stamina then the second slowest person in her group. As such she was subjected to a heap of blows almost everyday. By the end of the first month, she was able to perform at an average speed.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her life had turned like an eagle suddenly hit by lightning. Flying proudly high up in the sky, king of the sky, only to drop to ground to get eaten by all who served him. In another time, these soldiers would have lashed any who dared to come close to her in the capital&rsquo;s streets. Noble&rsquo;s prerogatives. And now she was being lashed by soldiers of the same army. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet she sorrowfully accepted all this. She knew her sister had done this to clean the family&rsquo;s name and throughout her life she had been told that family&rsquo;s name is above all. She thought that had she been in her sister&rsquo;s place she would have done the same thing, but she knew that it was a lie. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than that she knew with a certainty that escape from here would be impossible and more impossible would be to deliver any kind of vengeance to her sister. Not wanting to die with unfulfilled vengeance she had turned to the method of accepting her sister&rsquo;s actions as just and continuing on with her grim life.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The priest, true to his words, had stayed for two months. He would visit her everyday after dusk, waiting just near her house. He would also look over her in the mines, though he was very discreet about it. Felisin had luckily seen him once to gather this fact. At the end of the two months, he had wished her farewell then left.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dusk was almost on and the day&rsquo;s work was done. The slaves were released for the day, their pickaxes taken and then unbound from chains. They were now free to go to their dingy makeshift houses, only to come back again the next day. The houses were small enough to hold no more than a single bed and a table. The part of the city in which the houses were constructed was surrounded by walls so escape was impossible. In the morning they were chained here itself and then taken to the mines.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felisin was going to her house, just a few streets away from it.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Felisin,&rdquo; she heard someone whisper. She looked at the alley beside her. She had a few friends and the voice sounded like one of them. She entered the alley and was shocked by what she saw. Her friend&rsquo;s mouth was cuffed by a man&rsquo;s hand. Suddenly a knife was thrown at her from somewhere. So this was her end then. She was too slow to react, she knew and hence there was no escape. She had resigned herself to her fate when suddenly she was pushed out of nowhere. On recovering, she saw that it was none other than the priest who saved her.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The priest had expected this for a long time. The chance of Felisin&rsquo;s assassination had been very high. He had watched her family from ages and knew that Felisin was by far more intelligent and beautiful than her sister. Better than her in all aspects. Travore would surely have sent assassins after her. Although Felisin thought that her bondage had been for purely reinstating her family&rsquo;s name, the priest knew there was another aspect to it. In all of his visits to the family, he could clearly sense the hatred and jealousy that Travore had towards her sister. She of course did not display this in her personality, but him being a priest, he could detect more than what meets the eye.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On arriving at the minetown half a score of soldiers had seen him at the gate along with Felisin. When no attacks happened during the first two months and even the soldiers didn&rsquo;t misbehave with her beyond work, it was clear that whatever attackers Travore had sent would wait until his departure, clearly aware of his priestly powers. Hence he had created a ruse of leaving the minetown for good, whereas in reality he had stayed incognito within the city. He had been following Felisin stealthily and from a distance and his timely push had saved her.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked at the attackers. They were two in number. Although they had no magical powers, yet they were full of lethal and deadly weapons. Travore had clearly not thought about external powers protecting Felisin. Lucky for him and her, the priest&rsquo;s magical powers would just be enough to make the two assassin&rsquo;s unconscious. And so he began praying and concentrating on his God so as to gather sufficient power.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;My dear child Hood, you are one of my most devout subjects. And yet you haven&rsquo;t made contact in two months. You know the rules as well as I. So you will have to solve a algorithmic problem to prove you are still as sharp and devout as before.&rdquo; He heard his God&rsquo;s voice call in his mind.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;O great one, I am ready to face any tests&rdquo;. Hood thought in reply.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Very well then. Here&rsquo;s your problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are given two strings A and&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For any two strings C and D we define their similarity score&nbsp; S(C,D) as 4&sdot;LCS(C,D)&minus;|C|&minus;|D|where LCS(C,D) denotes the length of the Longest Common Subsequence of strings C and D. Find the maximal similarity score over all pairs of substrings of A and B. More formally, find out the maximal S(C,D) over all pairs (C,D), where C is some substring of A, and D is some substring of B.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The priest thought about it for a little while. He had seen such a problem before. It was similar to the problem of calculating </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longest Common Subsequence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in two strings. Thinking along those lines, he finally came up with a solution and spoke mentally to his God thus:</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Let </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">DP[i][j]</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be the maximum similarity score if we end the first substring with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A[i]</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the second substring with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">B[j].</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We will also allow the corresponding most similar string to be empty so that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">DP[i][j]</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is always at least 0.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turns out that the fact we need to search for substrings of our words is not a big problem, because we can think of extending the previous ones. In fact, we have just two possibilities:</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first case, let us consider that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A[i]</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">B[j]</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are the same letters. In this case, we say that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">DP[i][j]=max(DP[i][j],DP[i&minus;1][j&minus;1]+2)</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the new letter will increase the LCS by 1, but both of the strings increase by one in length, so the total gain is 4&minus;1&minus;1=2.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every case, we can refer to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">DP[i][j&minus;1]</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">DP[i][j&minus;1]</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to extend one of the previous substrings, but not the LCS, so: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i][j-1]) &mdash; 1.</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An inquisitive soul may wonder why it doesn't hurt to always apply case 2 in calculations, so clearing the doubts, it's important to informally notice that we never get a greater LCS this way so wrong calculations only lead to the worse score, and that our code will always find a sequence of transitions which finds the true LCS as well.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives us a really short O(n&sdot;m) solution.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Very well I am impressed. I shall grant you power for this occasion.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the priest felt a surge of energy within him. He concentrated it and directed itself towards the assassins. Before they could react a wave of energy swept over them and they were now in deep slumber.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After confirming that they were actually asleep, he strode towards Felisin. She was clearly still in shock.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Why would anyone try to assassinate me? I am already at the worst point of my life.&rdquo; Felisin blurted out.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Felisin, I think I will now have to tell you the truth. Your sister was always jealous of you and despised you more than anyone else. It wasn&rsquo;t apparent in her behavior but I have some priestly powers which allowed me to observe so. And clearly you were better than her in every aspect so the jealousy was forthcoming. She sent the assassins so that she could finally get rid of you for good.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On hearing this Felisin was shaken to the core. If making her a slave wasn&rsquo;t enough, she further tried to kill him. She could no longer handle it.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I, Felisin of House Paran, swear vengeance on my sister.&rdquo; she shouted loudly. The hatred towards her sister had started building.</span></p>
