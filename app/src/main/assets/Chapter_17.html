        <p><strong>A</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">fter nearly 4 entire days of travel, stopping only for rest and eating at night, Moravid and his army could finally make out the outline of the city of Necor. He could see the huge walls surrounding the city at a distance. He glanced back at the 20,000 villagers and soldiers who were following him to support the prince. They all were tired and restless after days of travelling, but Moravid could see the look of hope take over their gloomy faces as they spotted the city walls. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, the group travelled the last couple of miles with an increased enthusiasm and a faster pace. Soon, they reached the city gates. The soldiers guarding the gates stood straighter spotting the huge army at their gates. The most senior looking of the 3 men stepped forward and asked, &ldquo;What business do you have with Necor?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moravid stepped forward and said with as much confidence and authority he could muster, &ldquo;We are refugees from Malazan and we have come to assist the lost prince to take over the kingdom.&rdquo; The soldier walked back to his group and after a few moments of deliberation, one of the soldiers ran back inside the gates. Moravid hoped that the soldier had gone to call Artemus.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After about 5 minutes of waiting, the smaller door next to the giant door opened and a carriage led by 2 horses came out and stopped a few feet away from Moravid. A young man of about 20 years stepped out of the carriage. He wore white overalls and a deep red cloak around his neck. He gave out an air of authority and leadership by just standing there. But this was not what had captured Moravid&rsquo;s attention. He studied the face of the man in front of him and could clearly see the face of the late King. There was no doubt that this was indeed the lost prince of Brittania.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moravid dropped to his knees and bowed in front of the prince. Behind him, his entire army followed suit clearly in awe of the prince. The prince motioned for Moravid to rise and said, &ldquo;You must tell me you are before I let you in my city.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moravid looked up but still remained kneeling, &ldquo;Your Majesty, My name is Moravid. I served your father for many years as the royal assassin.&rdquo; The prince&rsquo;s eyes lit up in recognition. Moravid continued, &ldquo;When the King tragically died, I continued serving Laseen and resumed my royal duties. But soon, I began to understand that something wasn&rsquo;t right and that Laseen was hiding something about the night the King had died. So, I secretly started investigating this and soon found out that it was Laseen who had killed the King and taken up the throne for himself. I had secretly started organising a resistance against Laseen.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;But Laseen discovered my hidden motives and killed my entire family assuming that he had killed me as well. I went into hiding as I couldn&rsquo;t do anything due to lack of resources and manpower. But your majesty, when I heard that the lost prince has returned, I came out of my hiding and gathered all these men who swear allegiance to you. We are here to aid you with any means possible. We believe that you are the only rightful heir to the throne of Malazan and we want to help you get back the kingdom and kill the evil Vizier.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prince was silent for a moment as he digested Moravid&rsquo;s story. He finally put his hands on Marvid&rsquo;s shoulders urging him to rise and said, &ldquo;I believe you Moravid and thank you for your bravery and loyalty to the crown.&rdquo; He then raised his voice and addressed the crowd, &ldquo;You all may rise. I appreciate you travelling all this distance and coming to my aid. I promise shelter and food. You are all safe here. You may all rest until we have definite plans.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prince turned towards his soldiers and asked them to open the gates and escort all the people to the city barracks and ordered hot food to be prepared for all. The crowd slowly dispersed through the gates thanking the young prince as they went. When all the people had left, the prince turned towards Moravid and said, &ldquo;You may accompany me to the palace, Moravid. We can discuss the strategies and politics for this situation.&rdquo; Moravid and the prince got into the carriage and went inside the city gates.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moravid was awestruck as he looked at Necor through the window in the carriage. He had never seen any place as beautiful as Necor. The island was surrounded by a beautiful sea that shimmered in the sunlight. The streets were filled with large green palm trees. What made the city even more beautiful were its people. Children were running across the streets, climbing trees and playing. All the people seemed to leave in harmony and peace. There were sounds of laughter and general happiness everywhere. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus smiled and said, &ldquo;I know what you are thinking. I felt the exact same thing when I first came here. This place is indeed heaven on earth. This is what I want for Brittania as well. I want the people to leave fearlessly and happily forever.&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moravid said, &ldquo;As long as we have men like you on the throne, the people can never suffer. If you don&rsquo;t mind my asking, how did you manage to survive?&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, Artemus recounted all the events to Moravid. About how a soldier had managed to get Artemus out of the castle safely without Laseen knowing. He recalled how he had trained for years with the holy sage and how when he was finally ready, he went from village to village helping people and finally reaching Necor.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly the carriage stopped. Moravid looked outside the window to see that they were at the gates of the palace. A soldier rushed to the carriage and said, &ldquo;Your majesty, there is a woman who wants to meet you. She is refusing to leave until she gets an audience with you.&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus stepped out of the carriage wondering what could be so important that the woman couldn&rsquo;t wait. He saw a beautiful woman standing at the gates. Though her clothes were messy and torn like a slave&rsquo;s, she still had an air of authority and confidence. Next to her was a man who seemed to be a priest. He seemed as authoritative as the woman next to him. Artemus concluded that they were no ordinary villagers and indeed had some important motive to talk to him. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman stepped forward and bowed a little and said, &ldquo;Your majesty, apologies for stopping you mid way but I&rsquo;m afraid, this matter is of somewhat urgence. My name is Felisin Palan and this is the holy priestHood. He helped me escape my slavery and used his powers to teleport us to these lands. I understand that you are gathering an army to defeat Laseen. I have my own motives to defeat him and to personally kill one of his trusted noblewoman. Therefore, I&rsquo;d like to offer you my support and allegiance and help you take over the kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felisin then told them her story. About how she was an honorable noblewoman before her own sister betrayed her and sent her to work in the mines as a slave. When her sister had sent assassins to kill her, Felisin had resolved to kill her and thus wanted to help Artemus in order to exact revenge on her sister.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus listened to Felisin&rsquo;s story and said, &ldquo;Felisin, you are a brave woman who has remained unbroken by years spent in the mines as a slave. You are clearly not just an ordinary woman. I would be honoured to have a fine strong woman like you to join my army. And you priest Hood,&rdquo; Artemus bowed before the priest who raised his hand to bless Artemus, &ldquo;You are a man of honour. You kept your promise to protect the Palan family and have maintained your fidelity. I gladly accept you to join my army and help us all in this mission. This is Moravid, the royal assassin; he, along with his army, have swore allegiance to me well. We were going to discuss our battle strategies for tomorrow. You may join us.&rdquo; Felisin and Hood both knelt before their majesty to show their loyalty towards him and they all entered the palace together and immediately retreated to the meeting room to discuss the plan.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the prince, the assassin, Aegeus, and the noble got together and spent hours brainstorming and finalising their strategy for the attack on Laseen. These were perhaps the world&rsquo;s four greatest minds, together, discussing and devising a plan to overthrow the evil and bring peace in Malazan once again.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, Artemus' entire army had gathered outside Necor. It was a sight to behold as thousands and thousands of men stood in perfect formation with their heads held high and hope and strength in their hearts, looking with pride at the 3 leaders that stood in front of them. They would soon begin their march to Malazan, led by Artemus, Moravid and Felisin. Artemus turned towards the army and said, <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I will be forever grateful to you strong men for coming to my aid and helping me in our united cause. This journey that we are about to set on will not be an easy one. We will all have to endure hardships and face difficulties. But each one of you has a very important role to play in this battle. Let&rsquo;s gear up and march as one and defeat this evil that has taken over our beautiful kingdom of Malazan. Today, we raise our swords for every innocent who has died at the hands of the merciless tyrant who is sitting at the throne. Let us fight a battle that will remain a legend for generations to come!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire army cheered and thumped their shields on the ground to show their support for Artemus. It was the most beautiful sound any of them had heard. And just like that, they all began their march to Brittania to kill Laseen.</span></p>
