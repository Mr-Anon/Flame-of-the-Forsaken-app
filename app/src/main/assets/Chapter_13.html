        <p><strong>N</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecor was once a peaceful island in the middle eastern part of the kingdom of Malazan. It was an island with skilled warriors and craftsmen. Under the rule of the late King of Malazan, Necor was once an independent land and the people of Necor lived a happy and cheerful life. But under Laseen&rsquo;s rule, he subjugated the island, and had amended Necor&rsquo;s laws and people started suffering under his rule.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning about Necor and its amazing history of great warriors, Artemus with some of his men, decide to go there and earn the people&rsquo;s support. The journey consists of a trip through the desert till the seashore, and they have to go through the sea to reach Necor. They get prepared and pack their sufficient needs as they were ready to set off for Necor.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To first cross the desert, they hired a camel caravan. The distance to the seashore is n km. There is a town after every one kilometer, i.e there is a town at every integer point. There may be an inn in a town.&nbsp; The rider charges them with a reasonable price, the more the camels get tired, the more the fare. He charges </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for covering </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kilometer after taking rest ( a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increases with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">).To make sure they carry enough money before starting their journey, Artemus tells&nbsp; Aegeus to calculate the expected amount of travel fare. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;None of us don&rsquo;t know which towns have inns, so totally there are 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n-1 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">possibilities of distribution of inns. The total expected fare is nothing but the sum of expected fare at each kilometer, by the laws of linearity of expectation. Let total expected fare be E and expected fare for i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kilometer be e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> e</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> =&nbsp; (a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">/2 </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">)+(a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">/2 </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">)+(a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">/2</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">)+.....(a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">k</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">/2 </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">k</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">)+.....(a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i-1</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">/2</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i-1</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">)+(a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">/2</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i-1</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for every i &gt; 1. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because for the</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> k</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">kilometer charge to be</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">k</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there is only one possibility out of 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">k</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> distributions of inns from town at &lsquo; </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i-k</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &rsquo; km to town at &lsquo; </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i-1</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &rsquo; km.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for the last term, there is only one possibility out of&nbsp; 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i-1 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">distributions because the starting is already a rest point.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for i = 1 , e </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">= a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ,since it&rsquo;s the only possibility.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm, I can save time in calculations by rewriting the above equation as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i+1 </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">= e</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - (a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">/2</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">) + (a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i+1</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">/2</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After calculating e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and&nbsp; adding them up, I will get E .&rdquo;,</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking so, Aegeus calculates the expected value of travel fare and makes sure they carry sufficient money with them.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 4 days and 4 nights, they finally arrive at the seashore. Bidding farewell to the caravan. They arrive at the dock to board a ship to Necor.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus and his men finally reach Necor. They couldn&rsquo;t believe their eyes, it was such a beautiful island. The sea was sparkling and reflecting the full-moon lit sky. Bidding farewell to the crew, they get off the ship and walk along the seashore. The palms and other tropical plants bowing over the warm and transparent water glowing in bluish-green bioluminescence under the twinkling stars, the soft golden sand scratching under the feet, no words were sufficient to describe the beauty of the island. It was like heaven on Earth.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After spending some time on the beautiful beach, they leave for the city in search of an inn. Finally, after finding an inn after enough searching, they get into their rooms and go to sleep. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus wasn&rsquo;t getting sleep, and as too many thoughts were intruding his mind, he decided to take a stroll and calm himself. All of a sudden a bunch of young masked men run past him, carrying heavy bags with them. He just ignores them and tries to relax his mind. Then panting out of breath,&nbsp; a few guards come along the same way. Mistaking Artemus as one of the masked thieves,&nbsp; they start shouting, &ldquo;Thief, thief. He is one of the robbers who robbed the city mayor. Many major city documents are missing. Catch him!!!&rdquo;. Even the city sirens start to ring.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus tries to explain himself,&nbsp; &ldquo;Umm, I am not the one&hellip;&rdquo; but finds himself being charged with spears by the guards. He started running to escape their fatal attacks. &ldquo;Psch, they won&rsquo;t even allow me to explain my innocence. I have no intention of fighting them nor getting myself hurt. Hmmm, maybe I will just outrun them, once they are out of breath, I can explain everything peacefully.&rdquo;, he said to himself.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But things didn&rsquo;t turn out as expected. The people of Necor were very loyal and patriotic to their city. Hearing the siren, most of them leave their homes with whatever weapon they could find, spades, sticks, torches ..etc. to capture the criminals. They wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone steal the important things of their city just like that.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus finds himself sunken into a very deep trouble. Torches, spades, spears are thrown at him continuously. He runs as fast as he can. He reached a dead-end, and was completely surrounded by the citizens and the guards. They steadily approached him with spears and spades pointing towards him, having no intention of listening to him except capturing him alive and torturing the truth out of him.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus instinctively looks around to find something to defend himself with, and suddenly something caught his eye. Gleaming in the moonlight, he finds a magnificent sword embedded in polished marble stone beside him. He pulls it and puts on a defence stance. &ldquo;Yaaahhhhh!!, please stop it, I am not a thief. I am just a visitor to this city on an important work. I can prove it you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was shocked in disbelief, there was a sudden burst of murmuring, Artemus was surprised by their reaction. &ldquo;What is this all of a sudden? Till now they were all attacking me, and suddenly they are looking bewildered. Wait, did they recognize my true identity? No no, it&rsquo;s not possible.&rdquo;, thought Artemus, trying to figure out what was happening. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No he isn&rsquo;t guilty of the crime. He is innocent. We have caught the thieves. The documents are now safe and sound.&rdquo;, came a voice from behind. It was one of the guards who had captured the thieves, who were now tied up. Grinning with his accomplishment, he comes forward to calm down the people, but instead, he too gets shocked in disbelief.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mayor rushes to the spot, seeing Artemus with the sword, he drops to his knees, Artemus doesn&rsquo;t understand what was going on. Seeing their mayor, everyone falls to their knees and bow to him. <br /></span></p>
