      <p>  The cold waves lashed against his open wounds - the pale light of the moon that shone above him seemed to twinkle in his eyes - there was excruciating pain in his limbs and body - but he was ALIVE. His hands, despite having bled so much, still carried the young Prince above the water. As Mikhael frantically tried to see what came ahead of him - he saw a bright light….. A VILLAGE. He gathered whatever strength was left in his body and grabbed the nearest shore and laid down there. However, the village was on the opposite side, and he saw a pile of wooden logs in front of him - it was a broken bridge. Soon, he realised that it was impossible to reach the other end…… until he saw three such bridges.
      </p>
        <p>    Being exhausted, he knew that he could only jump 2 meters at a time, and he could see logs of various lengths one after the other. The complete river was 7 meters wide. However, even with the limited strength that was left in his body, he could conjure up magic to move the logs left or right. He began to think of a way to reposition the logs such that he could reach the other end. He realised that it was indeed a simple approach, where he could greedily move the logs so as to reach the other end. He went in front of the river, the baby still in his hands, and saw the logs of length 1, 2 and 1 in front of him.
    </p>
        <p>   He concluded that the order in which the logs were placed didn’t even matter - all he needed to do was place a log so that after making a max jump of 2 meters, he would land on a log. Thus, he keeps the first 1-meter log at a 2-meter distance from the end of the bank where he stood, and made the jump, trusting his algorithmic skills. Following the approach, he kept the next log of 2-meter length at 4th index, again at a distance of 2 meters. Now, he walks along the 2-meter length, and again places the final 1-meter block at the distance of 2 meters, and can quickly cross the barrier of the river that stood between him.
    </p>
        <p>    As delighted he was at crossing the river, he realised that using magic indeed took a heavy toll on his body, and he was unable to move his body any further.
    </p>
        <p>   In the small village that was illuminated by the moonlight and the bonfires around, he felt comforting hands on his otherwise frozen body. As he looked up, he saw an old wrinkled figure, clad in traditional white clothing. The soldier felt some more warmth - he was casting some healing magic upon him. However, both Mikhael and the old man knew that it was of no use - the arrows that he was shot with were enchanted as well. With the few moments that he had left to live, he told the Sage as he handed him the Prince, “He is the last blood of the Royal Family. The Vizier - he is evil and has killed the king and attempted to kill the Prince. Anyone who knew about his treachery was killed. Please save the Prince, and avenge the Kin…….” Realising that the poor soldier died saving the Prince, the old sage closed his lifeless eyes. However, the Prime Sage of Teblor, Aphrahat knew that it wasn’t mere coincidence that the Prince got here. It was fate itself. He was the Royal Alchemist and Magician and had served the royal family for three generations. However, with the Vizier gaining more and more power, he tried to get rid of all the Magicians who could prove disastrous to the evil schemes that he had been formulating for so long. The king couldn’t even smell how the Vizier had been planning this all along, and Sage Aphrahat had been suspicious of his schemes since forever.
    </p>
        <p>   He swore upon the body of the soldier that lay in front of him, to raise the Prince to be a mighty warrior, and one day bring back the throne to its rightful owner. Thus began the journey of training and raising of the young warrior prince.
    </p>
        <p>   As the Prince grew, Aphrahat subjected him to more and more training. He also made him maintain a sharp mind - making him solve numerous algorithmic puzzles. When the Prince was merely a child, he would give him challenges that even the wisest of the nobles wouldn’t be able to solve. The Prince, being five years of age, faced a long row of balls, with numbers all over them, and he would be asked to arrange them correctly. The window of time to arrange them properly kept decreasing as he would succeed. The Prince earlier used a technique - that he would later learn was called Selection Sort, where he would take the smallest ball, and place it in front at its correct position, and repeat this procedure for the remaining n-1 balls. Thus, when he would face the balls:
    </p>   <p>    64, 25, 12, 22, 11.</p>
        <p>  He would scour through all the five balls to find the smallest one, which was 11, and place it in front, giving him</p>
        <p>   11, 25, 12, 22, 64</p>
        <p>   Repeating the process, he would find the smallest numbered ball in the last four balls, which would turn out to be 12, and place it in front, giving him</p>
        <p>   11, 12, 25, 22, 64</p>
        <p>   Repeating the process for all the balls, he would get</p>
        <p>    11, 12, 22, 25, 64</p>
        <p>    11, 12, 22, 25, 64</p>
        <p>    11, 12, 22, 25, 64</p>
        <p>    Thus, he was able to quickly complete the challenge when the number of balls that lay in front of him was rather small, and he was able to keep completing the challenge in lower and lower bounds of time. However, the real challenge came in when the number of balls increased too much, and he didn’t have time to look at all the balls that lay in front of him, find the smallest ball and keep it at the correct position. He trained to run faster, but it was to no avail. His Master, Aphrahat told him, “The problem is not with your body, but with your technique….. You must not attack the balls as a whole, but must divide and conquer.”
    </p>
        <p>    Artemus pondered for days upon days on this statement, and it was only when he realised what the Sage actually meant that he exclaimed - “YES.”
        </p>
        <p>   The next day, Artemus decided to divide the collection of balls into two halves, 16 to 8, 8 to 4, 4 to 2, and finally 2 to 1. Now, he knew that all the segments of length one were already sorted. Next, he merged all pairs of segments of length 1. While merging these pairs, he would compare the first element in the unsorted parts, and place the minimum one in front out of these. As he would merge to obtain sorted segments of length 2, he would repeat the process for all the segments of length 4, 8, 16…. Thus, he had to traverse through the whole list 4 times only, and he was able to sort it. In the previous case, he had to go through the whole line of balls a lot more times. Thus, while the complexity of Selection Sort was O(N2), that of Merge Sort was O(NlogN), and so, Artemus was able to sort even the longest arrays with very fast speeds. So, when the Sage presented him with a large number of such labelled balls the next time, he was, to the very surprise of sage able to use this technique to do it!
    </p>
        <p>   The Sage was impressed that Artemus had so quickly discovered the solution to such a tricky challenge. He finally knew that the Prince had the potential to reclaim his Kingdom and to lead the resistance against the treacherous King. As the child Prince happily approached the Sage, the Sage said to him, “You certainly are the Royal Blood. One day, when you pass all my tests, I assure you, I shall tell you the truth…..”
    </p>
        <p>  After this day, the Prince’s training became only harder and harder. The Sage taught him various kinds of Magic spells - healing magic, fire magic, lightning magic, accompanied by the knowledge of mental skills that would always prove ever so necessary in times of conflict. It was only after several years of training, that the sage would tell him the reality of his pasts- when he would begin training for REVENGE.
