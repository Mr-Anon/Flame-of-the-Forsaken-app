        Artemus covered his eyes as he stepped into bright sunlight as he exited the cave after killing Septimus. He saw that the cave was surrounded by all the village people who had gathered there after hearing the terrible noises made by Septimus. They all stared in awe at Artemus as he told them that he had killed Septimus. Carak stepped out of the crowd and hugged Artemus and said, “Thank you very much Artemus. We are forever indebted to you for saving our lives. Is there any way we can repay you?”. Artemus smiled and said, “I didn’t kill Septimus to get something in return. I simply wanted peace and happiness in this village again. However, I am raising an army of my own to overthrow the king and once again restore peace and justice in these lands. If any of you are brave enough to support me with this cause, I request you to please join my army and help us in bringing happiness again.” The villagers shuffled nervously and whispered among themselves. Finally, the old man who had told Artemus about the magical entrance of the cave, stepped forward and said, “While we completely support you in your cause to help all the people, you must understand that we not young and powerful like you. We cannot embark on adventures with you and fight mighty beasts. But our village is known for its skilled craftsmen. We can provide you with all the weapons and supplies you need for your cause. We wish you good luck and pray that you succeed in your mission.” Artemus nodded and said, “Thank you. I am very grateful for your help.”

        Artemus bid farewell to the villagers and started walking out of the forest to continue his journey. He was about to exit the forest when he heard quick footsteps behind him and his name being called out by someone. He turned around to see Carak and a young man running towards him, “Artemus wait!”. Carak came to him out of breath and said, “Artemus, This is my friend Straff. We are very inspired by your motives. You are very powerful. You succeeded in defeating Septimus and we believe that you shall succeed in overthrowing the king as well. We wish to support your cause and help you in any way possible.” Artemus was impressed by the strength and determination shown by the two men. Artemus smiled and said, “Thank you Carak. I need men and women like you who are courageous and strong-willed.” Carak beamed at this and the men started on their adventure together with Artemus.

        They walked for about 5 hours. They stopped to rest under the shade of the trees and ate fruits and berries that they found on their way. As they were walking, they came across a river. Artemus looked around trying to find a bridge or a passage to cross the river. But all he could see was a nearly broken old boat. The water was flowing very heavily and it seemed very deep. Trying to cross the river by swimming was impossible. Artemus started walking towards the boat and said, “Looks like the only way to cross the river is by using this boat.” Carak seemed to get shocked by this and said, “But this boat seems very old. There is no way that it can support all of us.” Carak nodded and said, “We have to find some way so that all of us are able to cross the river in a way that we use the boat minimum number of times possible.”

        Artemus inspected the boat and turned towards the men and said, “The boat looks like it could support 100 kg weight. I weigh 50 kg, Carak weighs 50 kg and Straff weighs 100 kg. We need at least one man on the boat to steer it and make it cross the river. I think I know how we can do this. Just follow as I say.” The 2 men looked at each other and seemed confused but they nodded and did as Artemus told them. First, Artemus and Carak got on the boat. They both weighed 50 kgs each. The boat wobbled a little but managed to get rowed across the river. Next, Artemus dropped Carak on the shore and went back towards Straff who waited on the other side. Artemus got off the boat and asked Straff to get on the boat alone. Straff rowed the boat and soon reached the opposite shore to Carak. Straff got off the boat and Carak got in the boat once again and rowed it across the river towards Artemus. Artemus got in the boat along with Carak. Since their combined weight was 100kg, the boat was able to support their weight. They quickly rowed the boat across and hopped off the boat. All 3 of them had managed to get to the opposite shore in just 5 iterations! Straff and Carak were awestruck by Artemus' intelligence as they continued walking.

        As the sky started to get dark, they decided to go to a nearby village to seek shelter for the night. Carak knew of a village at about half an hour distance. Carak described the village to be known for its greenery. Carak said that he had heard many stories as a kid that this village was filled with luscious fields of all varieties of fruits and vegetables and that it was the number one village with maximum food supplies in the entire kingdom. Artemus was excited to see the village and its beauty now. But as they got closer to the village, they noticed that the grass had been dried out and was brown in color. As they kept walking, they saw that there were many trees which once might have been very green and full of fruits, but now they were completely writhed and dry with not even a single leaf on them. The entire village seemed to be hit with a massive drought.

        They soon reached a house. They knocked on the door and an old woman opened the door. Just like the trees outside, she looked very bony and dehydrated. Artemus was confused but he said, “We are travelers. We want to seek shelter for the night. Can you help us?”. The woman seemed apprehensive at first but then slowly opened the door to let them in. They walked into the house to see a small room with no furniture. There was an old man sitting in the corner of the room and eyeing the 3 men. The old woman said, “You may use the side room to sleep tonight. I’m afraid I don’t have any food available for you.” Artemus nodded and said, “Thank you for taking us in. If you don’t mind, can I ask you a question? Why are all the trees and plants in your village dry? There was a river nearby and yet it looks as if your village has been hit by a drought.” The old woman’s expression got grim and she said, “There was a time when our village bloomed with greenery and happiness. But some time ago, some thugs came and blocked our village river with huge stones and boulders. This completely stopped the water flow in our river. Our water supply was empty and thus all the trees and plants dried out.” Artemus said, “We can help you. We three, along with any other young men from your village can push and remove those boulders.” The old woman smiled but there was sadness in her eyes. She said, “It is not as simple a task as it sounds. Our entire village tried endlessly to remove those boulders but nothing worked. You see, the boulders are protected by magic. There is a spell written on the stones in a language foreign to us. The boulders can be moved only if the spell is deciphered. Many scholars tried and failed at the task. I suggest that you stop thinking about this and continue with your journey. Leave us to our doom. There is no solution to this.” With this, the old woman walked out and went to sleep.

        Artemus couldn’t sleep that night. Whenever he closed his eyes, he was haunted by the sights of the dried out trees and the sad and hollow faces of the villagers. He resolved that he would solve this problem by any means possible. The next morning, Artemus told Straff and Carak about his intentions to break the dam. They seemed apprehensive but didn’t say anything. They got up and thanked the old man and woman and went towards the dam.

        When they reached the dam, they could see huge boulders blocking the flow of the river. Artemus stepped closer to the boulders and saw, as the old woman had mentioned, a text written in a language that seemed similar to English but wasn’t. He turned towards Carak and Straff and said, “This dialect seems to be the subset of our language, but the order of the alphabet is different from what we use. There must be something else that we are missing. Something that helps us understand this language. Let’s split up and search the forest for anything that helps us.”

        After a few minutes of searching, they returned to the dam. Artemus and Straff claimed to have found nothing of relevance. But Carak produced a torn-up book and handed it to Artemus and said, “There was a small cave nearby, I went inside to check it and found these pages hidden behind a rock.” Artemus studied the pages. There were 3 pages with some random words written on them. After inspecting the pages, Artemus concluded that “These pages seem to be a dictionary for the ancient dialect. It has the same 3 alphabets that were used in the spell ‘a b c’. Fortunately, the pages still have their page numbers written on them. We need to use this ancient dictionary to reconstruct the ancient language.” Artemus looked at the pages, the first page was numbered as 2 and had the words ‘b’, ‘b’, and ‘bbac’ on them. The second page was numbered 0 and had ‘a’, ‘aca’, and ‘acba’ written on it. The final page was numbered 1 and had ‘ab’, ‘c’, and ‘ccb’ written on it.

        So first, Artemus set the 3 papers according to their page number. Then he studied the words written on them. Since a dictionary is always arranged alphabetically, he studied the order of the words and soon concluded that the order of the alphabets in the ancient language was ‘ a c b’. He rushed towards the spell and deciphered the language with the order of alphabets that he has concluded. There was sudden movement and one of the boulders fell down and water started flowing from the hole. Soon all the boulders started falling one by one as the water pushed it from the other side. The last of the boulders fell and the water started flowing in the empty river.

        Artemus, Carak and Straff followed the river and reached the village. The entire village was standing at the shore and staring at the river. The children were dancing and cheering while the elderly were staring at the water unbelievably. The old woman came rushing from the crowd towards Artemus and looked at him and said, “How did you do this?” Artemus replied, “The spell was written in an ancient dialect that is a subset of our language. We found a torn-up dictionary and we used it to decipher the language and decode the spell.” Tears welled in the old woman’s eyes and she said, “We can never thank you enough young man. You have restored happiness in our village.”

        The head of the Village also profusely thanked Artemus, and upon coming to know of his ultimate goal, assured him of complete support of the villagers in his journey. As it was getting dark, Artemus and Carak sat at a campfire, and all the villagers were celebrating with music and dance around it. As this fire illuminated the faces of both Artemus and Carak, Carak looked at Artemus and asked, “Who you truly are, and why do you want to overthrow the King?” Artemus' eyes turned dark, as he took a deep sigh to turn to Carak…...
