        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><strong>D</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">iffie-Hellman is fit for this job, being a one to one to communication encryption we can communicate without worrying about signatures or any pretenders&rdquo;, Artemus mumbled to himself, as he penned down another RSA-encrypted message for Carak.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deciphered-letter thus read:</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Carak,</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something fishy is going on. Without proper signatures, there&rsquo;s a flaw in our encryption, i.e. Anyone can send me the messages of the same encryption pretending to be you. They easily misguide us with false information.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please forget whatever information is received in the past letters, I came across a better encryption algorithm - Diffie-Hellman encryption.</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one-to-one encryption, unlike the previous one which was many-to-one. So we need not worry about imposters feeding us with false information.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just imagine this:</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will create a common secret chemical solution known only to both of us and no one else.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, we choose a common ingredient called &lsquo;generating ingredient&rsquo; , G and another secret ingredient of our own, each separately. Let's take a number, p.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, mine is A and your&rsquo;s B. I make a solution, by mixing &lsquo;G&rsquo; and my secret ingredient &lsquo;A&rsquo; in p:1 ratio. You do the same, make a solution by mixing &lsquo;G&rsquo; and your secret ingredient &lsquo;B&rsquo; in p:1 ratio.&nbsp; The mixing is inseparable.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I send this sample to you, and you send the sample to me. After receiving the solution we mix the received sample with our secret ingredient in p+1:1 ratio.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We both end up having a common secret solution which is a mixture of G, A, B in p:1:1 ratio. </span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can encrypt and decrypt the messages by dipping them into this common secret solution and chanting a particular spell.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose if an enemy managed to get the samples from the messenger he will get 2 different solutions of G-A , G-B of p:1 ratio each, from which he isn&rsquo;t able to make our secret solution unless he is able to separate the liquids from the solution which he can&rsquo;t.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds simple right? It&rsquo;s nothing but the Diff-Hellman algorithm.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diffie-Hellman is based on elements of a Field finite F</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">p</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , where p is a large prime.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can create a subgroup of F</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">p</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&nbsp; g : H = {g, g</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, g</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, g</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &hellip;...}, which comes out to be finite.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;g&rsquo;&nbsp; is called the generator of F</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">p&nbsp; </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">if&nbsp; g:H = F</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">p</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; i.e We can generate the whole F</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">p </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;by raising the powers of g.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decide F</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">p</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by choosing a suitable large prime p and we get our generator g aka the &lsquo;generating ingredient&rsquo;. We decide our secret numbers aka our &lsquo;secret ingredients&rsquo;, which is less than p. Say mine&rsquo;s a and yours is b.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will mix my solution from g, resulting in g</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">mod p and will send it to you.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly you will make the solution g</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">b</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mod p and will send it.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving the samples, we will mix it with our secret ingredient as (received-sample)</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">secret</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">mod p . We both end up getting with our common secret i.e g</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">a.b</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mod p. This common secret g</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">a.b</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mod p obtained from Diffie-Hellman can be used as a superkey for us in symmetric encryption-decryption techniques between us.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, the better selection of p, a, b, the more difficult it is to separate the sample mixture. Generally a large prime p, where (p-1)/2 is also a prime is a good selection. Large values of a, b are preferred and should be less than p.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">From here on let&rsquo;s communicate by adding this encryption.</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After exchanging the parameters, they were able to establish Diffie-Hellman encrypted communication and were able to communicate safely.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have to create a bigger army, I still need the support of many heroic organizations and gain their trust. I need to search for such organizations.&nbsp; Hereby, I entrust you to handle the updates of Zetopia and also take care of Kerman and start recruiting potential candidates and start weaponry production for the upcoming revolution. I will be messaging and will be visiting here regularly.&rdquo;, saying this and leaving Aegeus incharge, Artemus set off on his journey.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaleen on the other hand realized that Artemus didn&rsquo;t fall for his trap and might have gotten alert about him.&nbsp; However, from few more spies, he got to know that the rumoured prince was in Kerman. He started thinking about his next plans, &ldquo;Till now, I didn&rsquo;t stop the messaging between them and let it happen smoothly so that I could stay low and prevent any alertness about my presence. But they figured it out at the start itself. The fake message luring him into the trap also didn&rsquo;t work. Also, it is too risky to attack them head-on. But, now that I know that he is in Kerman, with help of the officials&rsquo; support I could still capture him and get some of the rewards. It&rsquo;s worth the risk.&rdquo; He contacts the officials and shares all the information on him. Kaleen, the officials along with their men and gathered soldiers to check in with their weaponry getting ready for the raid-attack.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After recruiting yet few other organizations, with a tiresome face, Artemus returns back to Kerman. However, to his utter horror, everything is broken, stone-pelted shops and houses, people lying injured here and there, children crying. There are a bunch of people gathered near the street pole.&nbsp; Confused and scared of what&rsquo;s happening, Artemus rushes to the crowded spot. Covered in blood, with torn clothes, a swollen face, deformed body,&nbsp; ripped off nails, lied there, unconscious Aegeus, smiling even in such pain. On the wall beside, huge words in blood were written, &ldquo;Artemus, surrender yourself by the fifth full moon of the year. You may or may not return and see this, and irrespective of that if you don&rsquo;t do as said, there won&rsquo;t be a single soul left in this village.&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling devastated Artemus let out a cry of anger and sorrow, vowing to take revenge. He carries Aegeus in his arms and runs as fast he can to the infirmary.&nbsp; Upon enquiring, an old man with his eyes full of tears replies, &ldquo;Kaleen and his men came on horses, pelting our homes and shops with stones, he started yelling out your name. Right then, Aegeus came and confronted him, and Aegeus and his men beat them black and blue. Just when Kaleen was getting beaten mercilessly, the government officials and soldiers attacked him. Aegeus&nbsp; and his men were now powerless. Aegeus got dragged to the market place and was tied up to the lamppost, and Kaleen started yelling again for an audience, asking your whereabouts. &nbsp; Except for Aegeus none of knew where you were exactly. He started beating Aegeus to a pulp and tortured him gruesomely, asking continuously about you. Meanwhile, Kaleen&rsquo;s men came and reported that they searched the entire village and you were nowhere to be found. Even in torture and pain, his deformed face covered in a pool of blood, Aegeus started laughing and replied &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that obvious Kaleen, he isn&rsquo;t a coward like you to be hiding in these situations.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then Kaleen started torturing him mercilessly, without a bit of fear in his eyes, he kept smiling without uttering a single word, till he fell unconscious. Then with blood flowing from Aegeus, Kaleen wrote something on the wall. He warned us that we will all be dead if you don&rsquo;t surrender yourself to them.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Then he leaves me with no choice&rdquo;, Artemus immediately sends a message telling Carak, Straff and all others recruited to pack up their weaponry and assemble in Kerman. Artemus then pays a visit to Aegeus and checks on him. He is quite recovered.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice seeing you, Artemus. Don&rsquo;t worry about the warning, I can manage them, or we could just relocate our village. You just stay as far as possible from this place, it&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hahaha, no no, not anymore, I&rsquo;ve been running away my entire life, since the day I was born. Not anymore&hellip;.. We have an army now. I&lsquo;ve called all the rebel organizations to assemble here. however, such a large movement will surely be noticed by the King, and he will definitely come into action. We have to prepare for the war on the expected day.&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected by Artemus, the officials get intelligence of the mass gathering happening. &ldquo;This matter can no longer be handled by us, it is not just a small fight anymore. Let the king be notified of the upcoming war as soon as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon coming to know that the battle that he had longed for so long, was about to happen soon, Artemus got pumped with excitement, as his thirst to kill the Vizier who wronged his family seventeen years ago grew even more&hellip;..</span></p>
