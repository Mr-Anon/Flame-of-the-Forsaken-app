      <p>  Moravid covered his eyes from the bright sunlight as he walked through the streets of Brittania. He was going to the local carpenter to buy a gift for his 6-year-old son. The young child had taken up an interest in swords and weapons, just like his father. Morvarid had plans to train the boy and make him an expert at using weapons and to one day, grow up and fill his father’s shoes. Moravid was perhaps the most powerful man in the kingdom. The late King of Malazan was so impressed by Moravid’s sword skills that he had hired Moravid as his personal assassin. Moravid had come to respect the late King greatly. He believed that the King was one of the justest and most noble man to ever rule Brittania.
        </p>
        <p>  As he walked, many of the villagers smiled and waved at him. He was even stopped many times by small kids who had wanted to shake his hand. Moravid was used to receiving this appreciation from the people of the kingdom. While acting as the assassin of the King, Moravid had saved the lives of the people on multiple occasions. Moreover, he was a firm believer in the laws and ways of the ruling of the late King. All this had led to Moravid gaining huge respect and appreciation from the entire kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>As the dome of the castle came into view, Moravid’s thoughts wandered to the Vizier now sitting on the throne in place of the King. Moravid had disliked Laseen from the moment he had first laid his eyes on the man. Laseen was an evil and greedy man whose only desire was wealth and power. The happiness and lives of the people of the kingdom were of no importance to him. Moravid never for one second believed the lie that the Vizier had told to the entire kingdom the day the King and the prince had died tragically. Moravid had personally investigated the case and could not find any sign of fire. This convinced Moravid that the Vizier had killed the king and the young prince himself and taken over the kingdom.
        </p>
        <p> Moravid hated serving Laseen but he still continued assuming his position as the king’s assassin as he was secretly plotting to overthrow him and restore peace in the kingdom. Moravid hated seeing the innocent people of his kingdom being tortured and treated poorly by Laseen. But Moravid was sure that Laseen was getting suspicious of Moravid’s plans. Moravid had to work fast if he wanted to succeed in his plans. Lost in his thoughts, Moravid didn’t even realize when he reached the carpenter’s shop. He asked the carpenter to show some toys for a young child. After going through almost the entire collection of toys, Moravid finally selected a very elegant looking wooden sword and a matching shield for his son to play with. He thanked and paid the carpenter and moved on to go to his house. On the way, he picked up some flowers for his beautiful wife.
        </p>
        <p>He happily walked towards his home, unable to wait to see the happiness on his son’s face when he saw his new toys. When suddenly, he smelled smoke. It grew stronger as he got closer to his house. He increased his pace and almost ran to his house. On reaching, he saw people gathered around. He looked at his house - that’s when he saw that his whole house had been burnt down! It was all ashed up and smoke was rising from the walls. He dropped the toys and the flowers and ran inside the house. It was filled with smoke and remnants of the fire. He shouted his wife’s name but there was no response. As he entered the bedroom, he saw the burnt bodies of a woman and a child on the ashen bed. He went to check their pulse, but both his wife and his son were dead. He prostrated on the floor and started crying.
        </p>
        <p>Moravid had no idea how long he sat there and cried. But suddenly he was filled with a feeling of immense rage. All he wanted to do was to kill the people who killed his beautiful family. It was obvious to him that this was Laseen’s doing. Vizier must have gotten suspicious of Maravir’s plans to overthrow him and like a coward, he must have sent his men to kill him. The men, assuming that Moravid must be in his house, set the house on fire. Moravid was furious. He stepped out of the house and caught one boy from the now dispersing crowd and asked, “Who did this?!”. The boy trembled with fear at the look in Moravir’s eyes but he stuttered and said, “Three ro..royal guards. I don’t know who they were but they were wearing r..red batches on their capes.” This was enough information for Moravid. Those 3 men were Laseen’s most trusted and skilled soldiers. They wore red batches to show their loyalty towards Laseen. Moravid went inside the house to retrieve whatever was left. But all he could retrieve were his bow and 2 enchanted arrows. All of his other weapons had been destroyed. Moravid stepped out of the house and ran towards the castle, resolving to kill those men.
        </p>
        <p>Upon reaching the castle, he went towards the soldiers’ barracks. He stepped into the main hallway which then divided into 2 corridors. One on the left and one on the right. The left one he knew was filled with dangerous traps and machines that would kill anyone instantly who stepped on it. These traps had been custom made by Laseen in order to torture the people he disliked. As he silently walked through the corridor, he heard voices from the right-side corridor. He stopped and tried to listen to those voices. He recognized the voices of the three men who had killed his family. They were laughing and celebrating their victory. They were evil men just like Laseen who took pleasure from the suffering of innocent people. Moravid clenched his fist in anger and instead tried to focus and get into his assassin killing mode. He quietly listened to the voices and tried to determine the location of the soldiers.
        </p>
        <p>Soon Moravid concluded that, if he considered the point where the main hallway divided into left and right corridors as the 0 point on an axis, then the soldiers were standing on +1, +3, and +5 points. He looked into his quiver and found the 2 enchanted arrows he had managed to retrieve from his burnt house. The enchanted arrow had a special power. Along with killing the man it struck, the arrow also shifted people standing close to the person by 2 spaces. Now, he had only 2 arrows and 3 people to kill. He closed his eyes and went through all the possibilities and opened his eyes when he was sure of his plans.
        </p>
        <p>Moravid stealthily knocked the first arrow in his bow. He took a deep breath and calmed himself. He had to be very fast and very focused in order to kill the three men. He concentrated on the sounds of the soldiers and aimed towards the soldier standing at +3. He released the arrow and ducked back into the main corridor as fast as he could. The arrow struck the soldier at +3 instantly killing him. And due to the impact, the soldier at +5 was thrown to +7 and the soldier at +1 flew at  -1. Since being on -1 meant that the soldier was thrown to the left corridor, he fell into the traps and screamed as he was crushed by the traps. This just left with the soldier at +7 who was still recovering from the shock of what had happened. But Moravid was already ready with his second and last arrow Knocked and aimed at the last man standing. He realized the arrow and the man at +7 was killed instantly.
        </p>
        <p> Moravid closed his eyes and recited a small prayer for the peace of his son and wife’s souls. He then heard the sound of the other soldiers coming towards him. Moravid couldn’t kill all the soldiers because he was out of weapons and also, many of the soldiers were his friends who had the same beliefs as him. As Moravid was escaping the barracks, he saw one of his soldier friends. He told him about everything that had happened. About how Laseen had murdered his family and how Moravid had killed the 3 soldiers. Thus, Moravid’s friends helped him escape the castle unharmed.
        </p>
        <p>  Moravid ran through the forest in order to escape and found an abandoned cave. He hid inside the cave until the footsteps of the soldiers searching to kill him went quiet. Moravid resolved to stay hidden and return when he was ready and kill Laseen. He stayed hidden inside his cave and only came out when he needed supplies.
