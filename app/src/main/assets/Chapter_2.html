    <p> The journey from Aren to Zetopia took Artemus over 5 days to cover. Zetopia was a village known for making the best weapons and armor in the whole Malazan kingdom. Artemus has heard that the people of Zetopia are known to be kind, lively, and full of happiness, and were the most hospitable citizens in the entire Malazan Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>   On the way to the village, Artemus saw that the farms and fields were on fire and some people were leaving the village looking sad and in sorrow. Outside of the village, Artemus saw people carrying the bodies of their family members and friends. Their bodies were out of shape and burnt. On his arrival, Artemus saw that the village is very different from what he has heard and expected. Instead of being lively and happy, the villagers were scared.
    </p>
    <p>   Artemus saw villagers loading up their carts to abandon the village. Although some villagers were leaving, most were guarding their houses with stones and metal scraps. Artemus reached one of the villagers, Carak, to ask if he could spend the night at his house. Carak happily accepted his request and guided him to the guest room. Artemus freshened up and joined Carak for dinner. At the dinner table, he enquired Carak about the weird things he saw going around in the village and why the people were leaving. Carak morbidly told Artemus “It all started happening a few weeks ago when the fire breathing dragon Septimus showed up in the village. First, he started burning the forest nearby but then he reached our farmlands and started burning the crops. When people tried to stop him, he started killing the villagers. Due to his wrath, people are leaving the village.’’ Artemus asks “Then how come you are not leaving the village?”. Carak replies “Everything I have done and everything I own is in this village even my whole family is here, this is my childhood ”. Artemus felt bad for the poor villagers who couldn’t face the dragon and were suffering because of it. After the dinner when Artemus was in bed he couldn’t stop thinking about the sorrows of Carak and the villager. So he decided to put an end to it. Artemus decided to ask Carak about the hideout of the dragon Septimus first thing in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>  Then the next day when Artemus woke up, Carak was preparing breakfast. Artemus asked him where he could find Septimus. To this, Carak replied hesitantly “Septimus has taken residence in the caves in the center of the forest. He stays inside during the day and comes out at night to hunt and destroy the farms. The area around the caves has been evacuated”.  Carak then served Artemus breakfast. Artemus ate the breakfast silently formulating the plan in his head. He then thanked Carak for his hospitality and left to seek Septimus.
    </p>
    <p>   After 2 hours of walking in the forest, Artemus finally spotted the mouth of a humongous cave. He couldn’t see the dragon from outside, which meant that Septimus was deep inside the cave and Artemus would have to go into the cave to fight Septimus. As Artemus walked towards the cave, he saw that the entrance was closed with 2 huge stone gates. He tried to push the gates open but they didn’t even budge. Artemus stood there wondering when he saw an old man cutting a tree nearby. Artemus went to the man and asked him about the cave and how to open the door. The old man looked at Artemus and said “This is no ordinary cave. It is a magical cave inhabited by the mighty dragon Septimus. Only a fool would want to enter this cave.” To this, Artemus said, “I wish to kill the dragon and save the villagers”. The old man started laughing but when he saw the determination on Artemus’ face, he stopped and said “Fine. I’ll tell you how to enter the cave but I must warn you it is no easy task. On the right-hand side of the cave door, you will find a table carved in rock. On the table stand 3 poles with one of the poles having 5 rings arranged in smallest to largest in size. If you succeed in moving all the 5 rings from the first pole to the second pole in the same increasing order, the gates shall open for you”. Artemus wondered about what the old man had said. It seemed like a pretty easy and straightforward task. But then the old man continued, “But here’s the catch. You can only remove one disk at a time and the disk should be present in any one of the three poles at all times.” Artemus now understood that it would be an extremely difficult and challenging task, but he was determined to help the people. So he thanked the old man and went to the cave doors again.
    </p>
    <p>   When Artemus arrived at the entrance of the cave again, he spotted the table with 3 poles. As the old man had told him, there were 3 poles with 5 disks on one pole. He studied the puzzle for a while and formulated a strategy in his head. Once he was confident of his plan, he picked up the smallest ring from the first pole and placed it on the third pole. Then he picked up the second-smallest ring and placed it on the second pole. After that, he picked up the smallest ring which he had placed on the third pole and placed it on the second one at the top of the second-smallest ring. Then he carefully picked up the third ring from the first pole and moved it to the third pole. He then took the smallest ring from the second pole and temporarily put it on the first pole. And he removed the second ring from the second pole and placed it on top of the third ring in the third pole. Finally, he picked up the smallest ring which he had put on the first pole and moved it to the third pole. He was pleased to observe that an ordered 3 ring tower had now been formed on the third pole. He repeated the same steps for the remaining 2 rings and soon, he had transferred the tower from the first pole to the third pole in just 31 moves! Suddenly, he heard a loud rumbling noise and saw that the giant doors of the cave were  opening. He had succeeded in his first task.
    </p>
    <p>   As Artemus walked into the cave, he observed that the cave looked even more enormous from the inside than it had outside. The cave grew darker with every step he took. He could hear faint growling sounds as he moved deeper and deeper into the cave. As he reached the center of the cave, he saw Septimus. He was a humongous creature with dark grey skin full of scales. He had 2 huge wings which expanded in anger as it laid its huge slit eyes on Artemus. Tiny puffs of smoke blew out of the dragon’s nose as it prepared to blast fire at Artemus. But Artemus rolled on the ground at the last moment and dodged the dragon’s fire. This seemed to make Septimus even more furious. Artemus realized that he must use his magic spells to defeat the dragon. He knew 2 different types of spells. One was a lightning spell and the other a fire spell each of which dealt damage equal to their power. But there was an additional advantage to using the lightning spell, if Artemus casts a lightning spell, then the next spell he casts does double damage. Septimus shot fire at him again, but this time Artemus took cover behind a small boulder inside the cave. He used this time to recall the spells he knew. He knew three spells from his training, a fire spell of power 12, a lightning spell of power 1, and another lightning spell of power 8. To defeat Septimus, Artemus must cast the spells in an order that would inflict maximum damage. As Septimus was bellowing in the cave trying to find him, Artemus stayed hidden behind the boulder and used this time to think of all the 6 possible combinations for casting the spells. When he was ready with his strategy, he stepped out of the boulder and ran across the cave towards Septimus. He thought that the best solution would be to brute-force among all the possibilites, and find the order which would carry him to victory.
    </p>
    <p>  As Artemus was running towards Septimus, he cast his lightning spell of power 1. The dragon was taken aback by this but since the damage was of only 1, Septimus remained unaffected by the attack. It started charging towards Artemus with even more fury now. Artemus used this opportunity to cast his lightning spell of 8, which did damage of 16 as it was cast after a lightning spell. Septimus was tossed backward by the force of the spell. It crashed against the wall of the cave. Septimus stared at Artemus, its eyes full of enraged fury as it prepared to blast fire at Artemus. But Artemus cast his fire spell of power 12 before Septimus could even move. Since it was cast after a lightning spell, it did a huge damage of 24. All spells combined did  damage of 41 on Septimus which was more than it could bear. Septimus wailed loudly as it burnt down and soon it was nothing more than a pile of ash at the corner of the cave.
