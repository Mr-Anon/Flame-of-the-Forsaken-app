        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he mayor asks him with tears of joy &ldquo;Who are you, oh worthy one? Only the saviour of Necor and the rightful owner of the sword who is just and destined to bring peace and prosperity to the whole kingdom can take the Holy Kelanved Sword.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing these Artemus felt the gush of his royal blood flowing through him. Rising the sword high in the air, Artemus declares, &ldquo;I am Artemus, The sole heir to the throne, son of the fallen king Daseem Ultor. I have taken an oath to end this tyranny rule and bring justice, peace and prosperity to the kingdom&rdquo;. Everyone&rsquo;s stance becomes erect with increased respect.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gently standing up, the mayor replies, &ldquo;Oh I see, 26 years ago the only daughter our king, the ever-beautiful princess of our nation got married to Daseem Ultor, the King of Malazan. After which, his Majesty Daseem Ultor promised to keep Necro as an independent nation.&nbsp; After a few years, with the death of the King, the newly crowned king Laseen came after us waging a war. His Majesty&nbsp; Durhang Ultor fought with all his might, trying his best to stop their filthy hands from snatching away our nation. Before breathing his last, he struck his sword here declaring that only the saviour of the nation will be able to take out the sword, and he shall the be the true and rightful owner of the sword who shall bring prosperity to the nation.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning, upon being advised by the city mayor, everyone in the city was told to gather at the market square. The mayor announces, &ldquo; We have waited for decades for our saviour to arrive and release us from the tyranny and this unjust rule. However, the wait is finally over!! Artemus, do you accept to lead the people of Necor with justice and prosperity .&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifting the magnificent Kelanved Sword high up in the air &ldquo;I, Artemus, son of Daseem Ultor, swear by the Almighty that I will be just and bear true allegiance to the people of Necor. I will without fear or favour and to the best of ability and judgement, serve as a true and just leader of the people of Necor. Hereby as its leader, I dedicate my life to Necor and it&rsquo;s prosperity.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing the speech, people started rejoicing and celebrating their new leader, &ldquo;All hail Artemus&rdquo;. The gloomy-looking people of Necor were now cheering with joy.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting from the first day itself, keeping the mayor as the head advisor, he starts selecting the ministers and other positions for the smooth welfare of the newly established kingdom. The current government officials in Necor under the king of Malazan who revolted against Artemus were either executed or were taken as prisoners. Notices were sent to neighbouring kingdoms, declaring Necor as an independent nation. Security was established around the island. Finally, total Law and Order were implemented. People were impressed with how smoothly things were going on. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News spread like wildfire about Necor being re-established as an independent nation. Upon hearing the news, Laseen got immensely frustrated, as his reputation was being tarnished all over. Seeing the King&rsquo;s frustration, commander ching bows and says, &ldquo;Lord Laseen, please just give me the orders, I shall bring you his head on a platter.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon receiving a nod from the king, an evil grin split on the commander&rsquo;s face, he and his battalion set off to re-claim Necor.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Artemus was expecting this, he had prepared to face the attack.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the parties arrive at the bridge, Artemus and his men on one end ready to defend the city, and Malazan&rsquo;s battalion and it&rsquo;s commander eager to attack and take over the city on the other end.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the city as origin there are n (n is a positive even number ) battle positions on the bridge, namely x</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,x</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,x</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,...x</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on which only one party can be placed per battle position.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They start destroying the battle positions one after another, taking turns until only 2 of them remain, after which Artemus' battalion takes the position with lesser coordinate and Malazan&rsquo;s battalion takes the position with higher coordinate.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battalion of Necor being skilled warriors in melee attacks tries to make the battle distance between them as less as possible. Whereas, the battalion of Malazan being skilled archers tries to maximise the battle distance between them.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being the battle strategist, Aegeus tries to determine the battle distance between the parties assuming both of them take actions in an optimal way.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hmm, so there are total n-2 moves, leaving (n/2) -1 moves for each battalion. If we assume we end up at position l, and they end up at position r. Then all positions between l and r would have been destroyed by the other battalion trying to keep the battle distance as far as possible and all the battle positions outside l-r would have been destroyed by our battalion trying to keep the battle distance as less as possible.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it is guaranteed that there would be (n/2) -1 destroyed positions between l and r.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other battalion should always ban points between l and r at each step.As long as the other battalion doesn&rsquo;t know what segment we have chosen, after our every move, they must detect a point which satisfies the above condition. So they would choose the median among the set of positions that are left after our move. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our moves, we can destroy some positions from the left or some positions from the right, except for the three middle positions. Two of it, (the leftmost and the rightmost) won&rsquo;t be destroyed by the other battalion soon as it could increase the size of destroyed positions from the left or right, but the third middle point always satisfies the optimality for the other battalion. This way they would always destroy the position inside the final segment.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence we result in a battle distance of the least value of &lsquo; x</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i+(n/2)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -x</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;. &rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling excited with the plan he made, he rushes towards Artemus and the mayor and explains his prediction. They all discuss a perfect strategy for the battle, recalling the past experiences from the battle, the mayor advises Artemus and the battalion about the enemies&rsquo; fighting technique and how to counter it. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the battalions start destroying the battle positions on the bridge. Finally, when only two of them were left, they occupy their respective places and begin fighting each other.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A devil&rsquo;s smile split on Artemus' face, the calculated prediction of Aegeus became true. Their battalion was at a huge advantage. They charge at them with valour and become victorious.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After capturing the commander and his men alive. Artemus tells him to deliver a warning to the king on behalf of him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever dare to even think of laying a finger on my people. The nation of Necor is and will always be independent.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showing them mercy, he releases them and sends them back to their Kingdom, as Laseen decides to take matters into his own hands and finish the Prince once and for all....</span></p>
