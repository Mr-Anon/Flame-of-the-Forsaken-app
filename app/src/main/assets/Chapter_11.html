        <p><strong>A</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">rtemus was desperate to find any flickers of life or hope left for his dearest comrade. Laying in his arms with a graceful smile, Artemus' best friend is lost forever and he is desperate for revenge. Unable to bear his emotions, Artemus yelled out a cry of vengeance, swearing to kill every enemy on the battlefield which was followed by cold silence broken only by the red misty breeze howling past by the ears. The switch in his mind went off, there was no sensation of fatigue in his limbs anymore, with a completely undefined state of mind, overflowing with revenge he goes on a rampage mercilessly slaughtering every enemy on his way, he was going for the king&rsquo;s head.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is too dangerous, he is outnumbered. I need to stop him at any cost and help him regain his senses before it is too late.&rdquo; sprinting up to the nearest horse which was running haywire amidst the war, taking the reins of it, Aegeus finally manages to mount it. He races towards Artemus and battles the enemies simultaneously. He grabs him by the armor and pulls him up. &ldquo;Leave me alone, Aegeus. That wicked Laseen doesn&rsquo;t deserve to live. He first snatched away my family, and now my best friend who was so dear to me. Nothing doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore other than killing him&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No no, you are wrong. Moreover, it&rsquo;s too risky for you to fight alone with the king&rsquo;s protection squad. We need to have a proper strategy before we attack recklessly.&rdquo;, Aegeus picks up the pace and swiftly rides towards their base.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Aaaargh!!! How dare you disobey me, let me go right now!!!&rdquo;, yells Artemus maddened with rage and sorrow.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coughing up blood and with tearful eyes, he smiles and replies &ldquo;What is a king, huh, all for the sake of the kingdom and it&rsquo;s prosperity. Carak&rsquo;s soul won&rsquo;t rest in peace until the people of this kingdom live in peace. Is this what he wanted to see? A psychotic slayer slaughtering people and seeking his own selfish revenge?&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus starts to regain his senses, his vision becomes clear, Aegeus was injured severely, he could again hear the cries of the fighting men, screams of the injured and the thunder of steel clashing steel, the throbbing pain in his limbs returned. &ldquo;Oh no! What have I done! I have put everyone at a huge risk. You barely made it out alive, risking your life in rescuing me&rdquo;, exclaims Artemus in sorrow and regret.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning to the base, Artemus carries Aegeus to the medics immediately. After getting minimal first-aid, Aegeus stands with all his might and says, &ldquo;These injuries are nothing, I still have a war going on to fight.&rdquo; Comforting Artemus he says &ldquo;Let us not lose hope yet.&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The war is still raging on, the king sends the next wave of soldiers, filled with vengeance and rage Artemus and Straff step up ready to take them down. Straff activates his byakugan, the ability of his eyes to notice the hp of anyone whom he can see. Being the army&rsquo;s strategist, Aegeus notes down the intel on enemies given by Straff. Artemus interrupts and says, &ldquo;Straff and I are planning to attack the enemies alternatively, taking on them one by one, but this is Straff&rsquo;s first combat, he is quite inexperienced, so make sure he has a chance to skip his turn, he can choose to skip utmost &lsquo;k&rsquo; times. Also, he&rsquo;s quite sensitive,&nbsp; so do make sure that the least possible number of enemies die in his hands.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the data, Aegeus mumbles to himself,&nbsp; &ldquo;There are &lsquo;n&rsquo; enemy soldiers in the coming wave, their respective health points,&nbsp; &lsquo;hi&rsquo; are noted down. Artemus' attack brings down the health by &lsquo;a&rsquo; points, whereas Straff&rsquo;s attack brings it down by &lsquo;b&rsquo; points. The enemy will die in the hands of the one whose attack brings his health to less than or equal to zero. Moreover, Straff should be made to kill as few enemies as possible. Also he can skip his attack utmost &lsquo;k&rsquo; times.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the given data Aegeus begins planning out the attack strategy, &ldquo;After enough pairs of attack, the enemy will have the health of either hi mod(a+b) if it&rsquo;s value is non-zero or the will have the health of (a+b), say that near-death health value is &lsquo;nd&rsquo;, if that value is less than &lsquo;a&rsquo;, the enemy will die in hands of Artemus. Else, in order to avoid death in hands of&nbsp; Straff, he would need to skip his attack &lsquo; LIF(nd/a) -1 &rsquo; times, let&rsquo;s store this is value be skipno</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Where is LIF(.) is the Lowest Integer function. But wait, he can skip only at most &lsquo;k&rsquo; times. So in order to keep least deaths on Straaf&rsquo;s burden, we will start attacking the enemies by the increasing order of their skipnoi value. Straff will skip his attacks as planned, till he is exhausted of&nbsp; his chances.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling proud of the plan he made, Aegeus rushes to Artemus and Straff and explains to them the attack-strategy. Nodding their heads, they gear up and start attacking them. Raging a war cry, they attack them as per the strategy, the wave eventually dies out before even reaching Artemus' base.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus and Straff emerge out after eliminating the current wave of soldiers. The optimal attack plan had worked out. Their small moment of victory is destroyed, the king again sends yet another wave of enemies. But this time the king had played his trump card. Artemus and his men lookout for intel of the upcoming wave. Aegeus grabs his binoculars and observes over the hazy battlefield.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The binoculars drop down from his hands. &ldquo;They are not just ordinary soldiers, it&rsquo;s the top assassins of the king and their men. They are the most deadly enemies to deal with. We should be highly alert.&rdquo;, cautions Aegeus to the army. He starts planning a strategy, he splits the army into squads and explains them the attack strategy. The squads start sprinting to the enemies, heading on with valor and courage, they were quite confident about gaining the victory.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus and squad proceed towards the central area, &ldquo;I have trained very hard, these many, I can&rsquo;t just let it go waste, I need to anyhow win this battle.&rdquo;, he told himself.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But all of a sudden, a thick fog started rolling in out of nowhere, it was dense and so thick that it would need a knife to cut through it. Artemus and his squad couldn&rsquo;t see anything. Nonetheless, it was the assassin&rsquo;s secret technique.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artemus opens his eyes, regaining consciousness, he is wrapped up with medicinal herbs and was lying down. He saw all his followers surrounding him with eyes of hope. Pain was throbbing throughout his body. Straff explains, &ldquo; By the time we came near the central area, the fog was dulling off. We could see shadows of you fighting 3 assassins all at once. You were stabbed but still fighting with all your might. We paced forward and fought them, once we rescued you, we found you in a semi-conscious state, many of us were being killed, we had no choice but to escape from there, we have managed to cut off the trail. You have been in bed for 2 days.&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling devastated and filled with regret, Artemus sits up and speaks tearfully, &ldquo;I am really sorry everyone, you all were put in much deeper risk because I wasn&rsquo;t strong enough. I got alert, the moment the dense fog started rolling in, we knew we were not alone, shadowy silhouettes were moving steadily towards us. And suddenly, we were being mobbed, getting stabbed by knives and swords coming out of nowhere. People were getting slaughtered like sheep before they couldn&rsquo;t even expect it. I should have known, but I didn&rsquo;t, that very mistake of mine cost me my men&rsquo;s lives. All of us except me were dead before we knew what had happened. The fog which was white dense was now misty red from the sheer of blood that split from the massacre. They all came at me at once, I managed to block some of the attacks, my limbs weren&rsquo;t moving as they were supposed to from fatigue, I could feel the adrenaline along with consciousness fading away, before I could do anything my mind was all fogged just like the red haze.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There nothing much left, he was left with very few yet valiant warriors. He walks to the memorial of the martyred soldiers and vows &ldquo;I will not let your death go in vain, I will definitely overthrow the King and bring prosperity to the kingdom&rdquo;.Artemus and his men gather at the funeral to say their prayers to Carak and the other brave soldiers who gave their lives for a noble cause. Along with the tears of Artemus, it begins to rain, as though Nature was trying to cool down his anger and vengeance. Aegeus lays his hand on Artemus' shoulder, promising him trust and assurance.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filled with sorrow and vengeance, he begins to stabilize the organization. He starts to send his men to gather as much intelligence as possible to gather more and more soldiers as possible. He is advised by Aegeus to try to gain the support of Necor, the Middle-Eastern part of the Kingdom of Malazan, that was brought under subjugation by Laseen after a long war, and could provide great support to him as they were specially unhappy under the rule of Laseen.</span></p>
