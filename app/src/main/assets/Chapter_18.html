        <p><strong>A</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">rtemus hadn&rsquo;t let his previous defeat carry him down. While last time, he just had the support of Villagers, who despite being valiant and brave, lost due to the sheer strength of Laseen&rsquo;s army, this time he had an army that was comparable to that of Laseen&rsquo;s. While Laseen&rsquo;s army took a great toll in the battlefield of Kerman, it was due to the defection of many of his soldiers to the Prince&rsquo;s side, the alignment of the whole country of Necor with the Prince, that Laseen wasn&rsquo;t so confident of another victory.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon many requests from Felisine and Artemus, the Priest Hood had agreed to give some magical powers to the soldiers of the army. With the State Alchemists of Necor on side of Artemus as well, he felt that it was indeed a battle of equals. As Artemus marched with his grand army to the Kingdom of Malazan, they decided to form their base in front of a Valley that stood facing the Castle of the King, where once Artemus resided, and now was occupied by the treacherous Laseen. Artemus sent a Royal Messenger to Laseen&rsquo;s court, that asked him to either surrender and return the Crown of the Kingdom to the Prince, or to face him in the challenge of war. After seeing the bloodshed that happened in the previous war, the Prince was hoping to settle this without having to lose more lives. However, he knew that the evil Vizier indeed didn't value the lives of his soldiers or people, and would try to fight the Prince and wouldn&rsquo;t give his Kingdom without a war.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing the message of the Prince, Laseen laughed, and shouted &ldquo;That self-proclaimed Prince tries to challenge me. I have ruled this Kingdom for the past seventeen years, and fakes like him cannot overthrow me with such ease.&rdquo; and he tore apart the message of peace that was brought forward by the messenger. It was indeed war - a war of the highest magnitude. With his army commanded by the Assassin, Artemus was sure of a victory. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a clear morning, with the sun over them as though it was giving them its blessings for the battle. With Hood&rsquo;s and the State Alchemist on his side - Artemus also had a trump card in his hand - he could summon DRAGONS to fight the mighty Chimeras that had previously been the reason for Artemus' defeat. As the army of thousands stood on the other side of the valley, Laseen also had brought full support of his army. However, Artemus again possessed the advantage here, as he was on the side of the valley that had the mountains, whereas Laseen stood on the flat side of the valley. He had again placed Archers, as well as spell users hidden in the Mountains. Using the Djikstra strategy from before, he had also assembled more than ever cannons, armours, enchantments, in addition to the heavy resources he had availed from the Necor. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the hidden spell users were State Alchemists, they were accomplished to destroy the Chimeras and other creatures using the magic that was emanating from Hood. However, in order to do so, it was necessary that the magic emanating from him reached every magic user. The places where each Alchemist had hidden were all interconnected by various paths, and the more paths that the magic of Hood would spread over, the lesser would its strength become. Artemus had to decipher this problem, and to solve it, he represented the places where each Alchemist had hidden as a node, and the paths connecting them as edges, with the weight of these edges as the distance of the path. Now, he knew that in order to solve the problem, he had to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph. Artemus&nbsp; grinned as he spoke to himself, &ldquo;It's </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prim&rsquo;s Algorithm</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he initialises the tree for connecting as an arbitrary node, i.e. an Alchemist. Next, he creates a heap to store the edges, i.e. the distance of the paths, and grows the tree by one edge, of the edges that connect the tree to the vertices not yet in the tree, he chooses the one of minimum weight, and transfers it along with its connecting node to the tree. He repeats the process as the tree keeps propagating to include all the soldiers to supply the power - the power that could just ensure their victory.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the trumpet for the war sounded in the arena, both the armies had their soldiers - the cavalry, the infantry charging at each other. However, this time Artemus had an equal hand in physical powers as well. Having the soldiers and Alchemists cast arrows and spells was of no use as the enemy had learned from the previous experience. Despite this, the soldiers, who were being led by the brave Moravid, with the powers granted from Hood, were slaying the enemy soldiers. As Laseen, who still stood atop his tower in the castle as the war continued to rage in front of him, saw his soldiers dying in mass numbers, despite having checked for traps like previous time. It was at this moment he shouted, with a grin on his face, &ldquo;Unleash the Chimeras!!!&rdquo;. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was something that Artemus had expected, as he screamed, &ldquo;Hood, it&rsquo;s time!&rdquo;, and suddenly, the whole battlefield was filled with a blinding flash. Moravid, who was commanding the army gave the order at that very instant, &ldquo;Unleash the dragons.&rdquo; Laseen watched in horror as the white emanating light, coming from the holes in the mountain killed all the mighty Chimeras that were his trump card. Hardly an instant had passed, when he also saw fearsome fire-breathing dragons rise on the enemy&rsquo;s side. His army was in shambles, as the fire breathing creatures started to annihilate the army. Some of the bravest soldiers in Vizier&rsquo;s army tried to take them down, along with the support from the Alchemists. Many of them sacrificed their lives in protecting the cunning Vizier - not because they liked Laseen, but because it was their oath to serve the person who sat on the throne, even if they knew he was evil. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With spells flashing from Laseen&rsquo;s army, they managed to take down the dragons that were unleashed upon them. Felisin stood smirking as Hood had indeed proven to be vital to their expected victory. Now that Laseen&rsquo;s army was almost obliterated, Moravid came to Artemus and Felisin, and spoke, &ldquo;Your Majesty! I shall clear the path for you, for you must now enter the castle soon, otherwise seeing his army losing the battle, Laseen and Travaore shall flee from the castle, and we won&rsquo;t be able to accomplish victory in the battle.&rdquo; Artemus and Felisin nodded, as Moravid, who was covered in the blood of the enemies that he had slain, jumped on his horse and cleared the path straight to the King&rsquo;s castle, with Artemus and Felisin following on horses. Artemus also killed various enemies who tried to attack him from the sides, as the Sword of Kelanved unleashed a bolt of lightning with each swing. With his magic, Artemus was able to give enough push to the&nbsp; horses to cross the trench of water surrounding the Castle, and entered Laseen&rsquo;s lair. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them held their swords in a defence stance, expecting great resistance. Moravid had stayed outside to stop any more soldiers from getting in, and to continue leading the army. However, to their utter surprise, the castle was indeed empty. Felisine told Artemus, &ldquo;It appears that all the soldiers had gone outside to fight. There must be traps on the way to guard the King, be careful.&rdquo; They knew that Laseen stood on top of the Southern tower, and Travore must be in theWestern tower, strategizing for laseen&rsquo;s forces that, and they both rushed on the stairs that led to the rooms. However, in between the stairs that led up higher into the castle, they both noticed a pit of lava! However, there were some blocks of rock in between as well. Artemus knew that he couldn&rsquo;t reach the other end simply by jumping on the blocks ahead of him. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pit could be visualised as a grid, of size m*n, and some of these contained lava, while the others contained rock. Using his ice magic, Artemus could turn some of this lava into rock by firing it on the lava. However, Artemus wanted to preserve his strength to fight against Laseen, and use the spell minimum number of times possible. Seeing the serious expression on Artemus' face, Felisin understood his thoughts and began to think of an optimum way to cross the pit. That&rsquo;s when it struck her - 0-1 BFS. Now, she represented all the lava or rock cells as node of the graph, and gave weight 1 to the edge that connected a lava node, and gave weight 0 to an edge connecting 2 rock nodes. Since there was just a one block path at (n,m) index, from where she could exit. Now, she had to start the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">0-1 BFS </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the 0,0 node and find the shortest path to the (n,m) node. She uses a double-ended queue to store the nodes, and initializes it with (0,0), and if an edge has weight 0 while performing BFS, then the node is pushed at front of the dequeue, while if it has weight 1 while performing BFS, then the node is pushed at the back of the dequeue. Now, we pop the front node, and find the distance to all its directly connected nodes. If any of these distances is lesser than the current distance for the nodes, then this node is inserted into the queue, and its distance and the parent node are updated accordingly. Repeating this process until we finish all the nodes, we get the minimum number of spells with the corresponding path to cross the pit.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Artemus uses the magic hardly 4 times and crosses the pit that seemed to be filled with LAVA, he and Felisine parted ways, for the King was on the Southern tower, and Travore somewhere on the Western Tower. As they both rushed, their souls were burning - burning for REVENGE!</span></p>
