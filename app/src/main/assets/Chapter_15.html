        <p><strong>T</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">he news of the lost prince&rsquo;s return spread like wildfire. People all over the kingdom were talking about this very event. This led to the kingdom being divided into 2 groups - people who supported Artemus and people who stood with Laseen. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former group believed that since the prince was alive, he was the rightful heir to the throne. They believed that the prince was just as strong and just a person as his father. Moreover, the fact that Laseen had lied to them about the prince&rsquo;s death, made them doubt the story told by Laseen. They all thus understood that Laseen had taken up the throne by some inhumane way and wanted to support their rightful king to sit on the throne once again and rule the kingdom. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while there were many people that supported and believed in Artemus, there were some people who still followed Laseen. They mostly consisted of corrupted noblemen who, like Laseen, were selfish and put their own greed above the lives of the people in the kingdom. They believed that if Laseen was removed and Artemus got the throne, then they would no longer be able to indulge in their illegal schemes. Thus, they stood with Laseen and promised to support him instead of Artemus. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news of the prince&rsquo;s return also reached the royal assassin Moravid, who was in hiding after killing the royal soldiers and avenging the murder of his family. This was perhaps the first piece of positive news that he had heard since his escape years ago. He found new hope and resolved to find Artemus and place him on the throne instead of the evil Vizier, who was never the King in his eyes. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amongst the news of Artemus' return, another shocking news started spreading. People learnt that Artemus was last seen in the continent of Necor. Necor was a continent under the kingdom of Malazan. Under the rule of the late King, Necor was kept as an independent land and the people of Necor lived a happy life. But under Laseen&rsquo;s rule, he had undertaken over Necor as well, and the people started suffering under his rule.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, the news came that Artemus had gone to Necor and had managed to take the holy sword of Necor, Kelanved. The sword could only be taken by the rightful owner who is just and true to the people of the kingdom. Artemus had taken the sword which had led the entire population of Necor to follow him and proclaim Artemus as their king. They supported Artemus and were willing to fight him against Laseen. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing this news, Moravid&rsquo;s renewed hope increased even further. Artemus now had the entire army of Necor with him. Moreover, the kingdom of Necor believed Artemus to be their rightful king. Now came Moravid&rsquo;s duties. He planned to gather all the soldiers and villagers who wanted to support Artemus and take them to Necore with safety. If Moravid succeeded in doing so, this would increase Artemus' army and power significantly.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moravid put on his fake disguise and stepped out of his hiding. He walked through the village. He could hear people murmuring and discussing the fate of the kingdom. He kept walking until he came across a young boy. He called the boy and asked him, &ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo;. The boy looked confused for a moment as he observed Moravid&rsquo;s face. Suddenly, his face lit up and he said, &ldquo;Are you Moravid? The great assassin?!&rdquo; Moravid smiled and nodded and said, &ldquo;Yes I am and I have a very important task for you. I want you to contact every person in the kingdom who supports the prince and ask them to collect near the forest by the lake at 9 pm sharp.&rdquo; The boy beamed and nodded and ran off to talk to the villagers.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moravid then went towards the castle. He sneaked into the soldier barracks and found one of his soldier friends. The soldier was shocked on seeing Moravid and said, &ldquo;Moravid! What are you doing here? I thought you had run away.&rdquo; Moravid said, &ldquo;I was in hiding. I came out because of the news about our prince which I&rsquo;m sure you must have heard too. I am gathering an army to go support him. I want you to find all the men who support us in this cause and bring them to the forest near the lake at 9 pm sharp.&rdquo; The soldier seemed apprehensive for a moment but then he nodded determinedly and walked off to find the other soldiers.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That night, Moravid waited at their secret spot. He was anxious whether many people would show up or not. He told himself that any number of people who show up would significantly help Artemus' army. He waited for a few minutes when he heard footsteps. He saw more than 20,000 people slowly gathered at the spot. They all looked determined and hopeful to help Artemus. Moravid couldn&rsquo;t help but smile as he saw that almost half of the royal army had joined them. He gathered the people and said, &ldquo;Thank you all for coming. These past years have been very difficult for us under the rule of villainous Laseen . But those days of terror are about to get over. We just need to cross this river and march towards Necor and join Artemus' army.&rdquo; The crowd cheered and they moved on to cross the river.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laseen was now fuming with anger. He had heard the news from his trusted spy a few moments ago. Apparently, Moravid wasn&rsquo;t dead at all like he believed. He had been in hiding all this time. Moreover, Moravid had managed to gather an army and was marching to Necor. But Laseen would never let Moravid succeed with his plans. He stood at the terrace of the royal castle. He had his most trusted soldier with him. He had aimed the canon right at the bridge atop the river. It was the only way to leave the kingdom and Laseen was sure that Moravid will take his army via that very path.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laseen kept staring at the bridge, burning with rage. Suddenly, he saw some dark silhouettes on the bridge. He could make out some humanoid shapes. He ordered his soldier to fire. There was a loud boom as the cannon blasted. Laseen strained to see as the smoke cleared. He saw that the bridge was burning and it had broken at the spot where the silhouettes had stood. Laseen laughed and his voice echoed through the entire castle.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moravid closed his ears at the loud boom of the cannon firing. He stood in the secret tunnel with his entire army. He smiled as he realized that he had been successful in fooling Laseen. Moravid had known the news of their escape would definitely reach Laseen. He knew that Laseen was a heartless man and would kill anyone who dared disobey him. So, he planted some humanoid dummies made of wood and leaves on the bridge. Laseen had blasted the bridge thinking that he had killed Moravid and his army. Hence, Moravid and his army marched through the secret tunnel that led outside the kingdom, and continued on their journey to Necor&hellip;..</span></p>
