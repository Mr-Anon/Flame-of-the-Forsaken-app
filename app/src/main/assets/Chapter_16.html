        <p><strong>A</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">fter another day of hard work, Felisin was returning to her house. Waiting for her in an alley near her house was the priest, Hood. After the failed the assassin attempt, all Felisin could think about was vengeance. She had requested Hood to find a way to escape this hellhole, so that she could exact her revenge on her sister. <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The priest, having been reminded of his oath to Felisin&rsquo;s father, obliged and ever since that night he would roam the town housing the slaves looking for a way to escape the town. The law of the land dictated that priests couldn&rsquo;t be made slaves so he was allowed free passage to and fro from the town. Naturally, soldiers were suspicious about his activities but his show of blessing slaves made the soldiers think that he was just a missionary and the suspicions soon faded.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the night, when he was sure that the soldiers weren&rsquo;t around him, he would travel various streets and use his priestly powers to check if there were any tunnels under the ground. He had been doing this search for multiple days now. Unfortunately, he had been unable to find any underground structure that could have been used for escaping. Up until now.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, after searching more than half the city he was sure he would have to dig a tunnel himself, maybe start from a two miles outside the city and then dig right under Felisin&rsquo;s house. This excursion would definitely take multiple months, if not years but alas it seemed to be the only option. He was headed back to the alley where he would usually wait to inform Felisin about his findings. Knowing that he had arrived early, he was curious about Felisin&rsquo;s house. Although he had been with her for more than three months now, yet he had never visited her house, rather only seen it from outside.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that he still had time, the priest decided to visit Felisin&rsquo;s house. He passed through her house&rsquo;s door to find a dingy room, with space only for a table and a bed. He was pitying Felisin and used his priestly power to study the house&rsquo;s underground, to make sure that the floor of her house wouldn&rsquo;t give way in the middle of the night. Mysteriously he found a spirit under the house.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What are you doing under this house, O spirit?&rdquo; The priest spoke telepathically to the spirit.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Priest, you had helped me one of my kin in the past. I have seen your struggle to save this girl and thought to help you. Hence I took the underground of your house as my abode. In hope that you would sense me and I could help you back.&rdquo; The spirit replied.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And how may you help me spirit? I have searched half the city and still haven&rsquo;t been able to find a proper route for escaping.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well then, it seems there are some magical powers you are yet unable to sense. Anyways my spiritual form allows me to travel pretty fast, so&nbsp; I also have information about other events, events outside the city.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Can you elaborate.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well due to some unexpected events groups of cities have rebelled against the Empire and now seek to create their own Empire. Some elements of the rebel&rsquo;s army have now decided to free this minetown. They will be here in some days, attacking from the east walls.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, isn&rsquo;t it? Finally we will be free without even doing anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Priest, I have walked in this town for many years now. There&rsquo;s a silent decree in this town and in fact in all the slave towns of the empire. It states that when a town is about to fall to a siege all valuables should be destroyed so that the victors find nothing but ruins. These valuables, as you very well know priest, also includes slaves.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Does that mean that Felisin&rsquo;s death is certain.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No, I have some magical power through which I can arrange for a safe passage for you two. The soldiers will be mostly located on the east wall, so the west wall will mostly be empty. I can open a portal there, since my source of power is very close to you. I hope you can handle any soldiers that will remain there, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yes, surely. I thank you with all my heart.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Beware though, the portal only opens to the worthy. It will test you and you will have to pass the test to go through it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We will pass the test, no doubt.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Okay then, when you hear sounds of war come to the west walls.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so the conversation endered. The priest informed all this to Felisin and they waited for the rebellion to start.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was still dawn, before they were sent to the mines when they started hearing shouts and seeing arrows shot into the town from outside the walls. As predicted most of the soldiers strode towards the east walls. Together, Hood and Felisin trodded towards the west wall. As soon they reached there, a portal started forming in front of them. The few soldiers remaining on the west wall raised the swords, but the priest calmed them down by stating that he was performing a ritual for the victory of the Empire, sacrificing the slave beside him. The soldiers calmly accepted his explanation, clearly all of them being low ranked soldiers.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having calmed the soldiers, the priest passed through the portal, his last words to Felisin being &ldquo;I am sure you will pass the test.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What test, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felisin wondered. She entered the portal. Suddenly there was a darkness around her. Then a voice suddenly thundered in her mind, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortal, only the worthy shall use this portal. To prove your worthiness you must answer this question. You are given two integers P and Q. You have to find the greatest integer X such that firstly, P is divisible by X and secondly, X should not be divisible by Q. In big O notation, your solution should have a complexity around the square root of Q. Are you worthy?</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felisin had solved a similar question before, when she was young. She thought about it for a little while, then started speaking.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Let y=p/x. Let's assume, that there exists prime a, such that a divides y, but q is not divisible by a. Then we can multiply x and a and the result will still divide p, but will not be divisible by q. So for maximal x there is no such a.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let's assume that there are two primes a and b, such that they both divide y, and both divide q. Because q is not divisible by x, there exists some prime c (c can be equal to a or b), such that the number of occurrences of c in x is less than the number of occurrences of c in q. One of a and b is not equal to c, so if we multiply x and such numbers, the result will not be divisible by q. So for maximal x there are no such a and b.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that x=p/(power of some primal divisor of q). So to find maximal x, we have to find all prime divisors of q (we have to factorise q for it in time O(&radic;q)) and for each of them divide p by it until the result is not divisible by q. That will be all our candidates for greatest x. We will do all of that in time O(&radic;q+log q&sdot;log p).&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very well, you are worthy. You shall pass. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">She heard in her mind. Then suddenly a thundering of colors erupted around her. She closed her eyes and when she opened her eyes she was in a silent alley of a city and beside her was the priest. Looking at the architecture around her, she knew she was in a city of the Empire.</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally at last she was free. Free to exact vengeance. I am coming for you sister.</span></em></p>
