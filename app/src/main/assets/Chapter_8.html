        <p><strong>C</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">arak had turned very sad upon hearing Artemus' stories, and further offered him his sympathies, and promised to help him in his mission until its very end. Their friendship had deepened a lot in the past few days. Finally, after gathering the support of two large villages, Artemus bids them farewell and sets off for a journey to the nearby village Kerman, to further expand his army. Carak also stays behind to train the villagers, and to gather the best armour in Zetopia, promising Artemus that they would meet soon. Artemus' exhaustive journey across the fuscous-brown barren desert, bearing the cankerous heat and the cantankerous cold was heart-haunting. After three days and three nights of harsh weather and hunger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he finally reaches Kerman and takes shelter from an inn. After taming his growling stomach with sumptuous dinner, he goes back to his room. Thinking about the plans, strategies, and fighting the intruding dark memories of his past, he falls asleep. Waking up, he realizes he needs to be in touch with Carak, and establish the flow of information. He takes a small tour of Kerman, keeping the hope of recruiting a trustworthy comrade with which he can gain an army and earn enough power to overthrow the treacherous king.&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After staying in the village and interacting with the villagers, he learns about Aegeus, a hero who keeps the village in peace and protecting it from the treacherous, cunning government officers. He was the hope of the people who are living peacefully who once were in rags, and tormented by the kings&rsquo; men.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He finally meets Aegeus, the huge body with a pompous chest, sturdy calves, he was built like an engine. Under the gleam of the sun rays, with the sparkling smile greets him.</span></p>
         
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Greetings Aegeus, the hero of the village, I have heard that you want to bring a revolution to this kingdom and bring forth peace and prosperity to the people. I, Artemus , the son of Daseem Ultor want to dethrone the greedy, evil king and end the suffering of the kingdom and its people and attain them peace and prosperity. You could join us, and help us achieve our goal.&rdquo;</span></p>
         
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hmph, what makes you think that you can trust me?, tell me one thing: What exactly is a king ?&rdquo;</span></p>
         
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Haha, the people of this village believe in you, all their hopes lie within you. Even if you were to betray me, I would die gladly without regrets, believing that the kingdom and it&rsquo;s people definitely will attain peace and property with you around. You aren&rsquo;t such a fool of a human to leave the suffering of the people astray. A king is both, the head of the people and the people&rsquo;s slave. For the survival and welfare of the kingdom, they gladly would put themselves in any kind of trouble. They develop their people and place them where they best fit. They could take definite actions against its own people, for their welfare and protection. That&rsquo;s a king, all for the kingdom and it&rsquo;s prosperity.&rdquo;</span></p>
         
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moved by Artemus' words, Aegeus falls on his knees and pledges, &ldquo;Then I , Aegeus, will dedicate my blood and all that I am to you, Artemus. I will protect this kingdom and it&rsquo;s people that you support, I will work for you and decimate the people who are a threat to the kingdom and it&rsquo;s prosperity&rdquo;.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, something that the Artemus had feared had already conspired. The information that someone was gathering an army, and rumours that he was of Royal Blood had started to circulate. Hearing these rumours, Kaleen, who was a local bandit decided to find this person, for he knew that the King would give him a great reward for catching a treacherous citizen. He heard some rumours that Artemus was last seen in Zetopia and he had some rebellious preparation going on in that village. He lets out a burst of evil laughter, the only path to Zetopia goes through the very forest in which Kaleen and his men have their hideout. He and his men start threatening every messenger passing this way to reveal their scrolls, in an attempt to find the true location of Artemus.&nbsp;</span></p>
         
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon learning this Carak sends his updates to Artemus by sending a scroll with a low-level encryption message.</span></p>
         
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Url Pw,</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubcr lbh ner qbvat svar.</span></em></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon receiving the message, being as smart as he is Artemus smiles and says, &ldquo;As expected of you, Carak.&rdquo;. Seeing Aegeus&rsquo; confused face, he says, &ldquo;This is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caeser&rsquo;s Cipher</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it&rsquo;s one of the substitution ciphers. Carak must have sensed some trouble and must have encrypted it. Caesar&rsquo;s Cipher encryption is done by shifting the letters of message by fixed number of positions. For example for a right shift of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E and so on&hellip; In this case, it looks like it is 13.&rdquo; Artemus starts deciphering it, and voila:</span></p>
         
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Artemus,</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope you are doing fine.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the messengers in our village come and go via the forest path, reporting the scroll contents to Kaleen on being threatened. He might soon employ a cryptographer too, by which low-level encryptions like this won&rsquo;t be helpful anymore.</span></em></p>
         
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information updates are highly sensitive and is top-secret, Artemus wants his communication with Carak as secure as possible, but all the messengers are unreliable. So, Artemus starts thinking about better ways of encryption. Pop!! An idea struck him, and he decided to use RSA encryption. He immediately starts writing about RSA encryption and sends it to Carak in Caeser Cipher.</span></p>
         
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deciphered-letter thus read :</span></p>

        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Carak,</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 500;"><br /></span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s play a small game,</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s a bunch of identical locks. They all have one opening key for it. The lock locks itself once you close it.&nbsp; Say you have a friend with whom you want to share secrets.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the lock&rsquo;s blueprint, he makes a lock, dumps the secret into a box, and locks the box with that particular lock. After receiving the box, you open it with the opening key and receive the secret safe and sound.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple right?</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s nothing but RSA encryption.</span></em></p>
         
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, all you have to do is pick two large prime numbers p,q.</span></em></p>
         
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let the message after converting it to a number form using a suitable algorithm be m.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let their product be n.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the Euler&rsquo;s totient of n say phi. In this case it&rsquo;s phi = (p-1). (q-1).</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose any number between 1 and phi as e.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be your encryption key, aka the &ldquo;lock blueprint&rdquo;, which you give to your friends.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now find a number d between 1 and phi, such that (d.e)mod(phi)=1.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This d is your decryption key, aka the &ldquo;key&rdquo;.</span></em></p>
         
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say my keys are d1 (secret), and the lock blueprint is e1.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your key is d2(secret), and the lock blueprint is e2.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will write a message, convert it into a number m by a suitable algorithm and lock it in the box with your lock e2 by</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">c=(m^e2)mod n;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">When this box arrives, you simply can unlock it with your secret opening key d2 by:</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">m=(c^d2)mod n</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">And vice-versa with e1 and d1 for me</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as p,q are large enough, it&rsquo;s difficult for people to make the key from the lock&rsquo;s blueprint.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go, let&rsquo;s communicate using this technique from now on.</span></em></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After passing two messages with each other Artemus and Carak establish RSA encryption, before Kaleen could even get a cryptographer. Upon learning that from his cryptographer that some messages were in RSA, Kaleen is also explained about RSA. An evil grin split on Kaleen&rsquo;s face, for he knew something like this would happen, and he had made duplicates of all messages till the cryptographer came. After receiving the copies from Kaleen, the cryptographer identifies Carak&rsquo;s and Artemus' messages and he notes down e1, e2 from the first two deciphered messages. One day he writes a message to Artemus, giving him false information and luring him to a trap that he just setup, pretending to be Carak and encrypting it in RSA with&nbsp; e1 and sends it to Artemus without suspicion. Unfortunately, here&rsquo;s the catch, RSA is designed for many to one encryption. People can make copies of the lock&rsquo;s blueprint and send messages to Artemus too. Without proper signatures, we can&rsquo;t know from whom the messages are coming from.&nbsp; What Artemus needs currently is one-to-one encryption. After receiving and decrypting the message, Artemus realizes something is off. Maybe he got tricked, he realizes that even if&nbsp; someone deciphered the caesar ciphered messages and knew e1,e2 he may not be able to read the messages but can write them as if he were Carak impersonating him and luring him into a trap.</span></p>
        <p><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a confident smile spread across his face, Artemus gets confident enough about a better encrypted messaging technique..&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>
