        <p><strong>A</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">rtemus prodded stealthily. His path to Laseen&rsquo;s stronghold on Southern tower had remained uncontested, and he was beginning to wonder whether Laseen had escaped along with his soldiers. An honorable king would have fought with soldiers up till the very bitter end. But Laseen had no honor, and the prince knew that. Hence he hurried his steps.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could have allowed Laseen and his bodyguards to escape, the first act of mercy from the new king. But he knew that the escaped Vizier would do nothing other than thinking how to usurp the throne once more, and hence sparing Laseen would mean inviting his own demise. Moreover Laseen had killed his family, his loyal guards. And it now fell on the prince to exact vengeance for his fallen familiars.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prince was now close to Laseen&rsquo;s quarters. He kicked open the gate to find a weird scene before him. The roof of the stronghold had broken and he could see a black abyss flying in the sky above him, moving swiftly away from the kingdom. The prince knew that Laseen was in the black cloud, the cloud probably being the creation of his magic. The prince wasted no time in chasing them and whisted in a mystic way to call upon his own dragon. The dragon arrived in no time. The prince soon settled upon the dragon and then they were flying in chase of Laseen.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laseen&rsquo;s dragon may have been fast, but the prince&rsquo;s was way faster. They were soon near the black cloud and soon entered it. The prince, still seated on his dragon, found the dragon to be standing on a mystical leaf, big enough for a score of humans to stand on. He could see multiple such leaves all around him, with every leaf having a number written on it. Artemus looked down and saw that even his own leaf had a number.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of him, on another leaf was Laseen. There were no soldiers around him. He had escaped alone, having only a single dragon for travelling. Although he was far away, when Laseen spoke the prince could hear him clearly.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;O prince so at long last you have arrived. Thinking you will get your vengeance? Hah! How arrogant and foolish of you.&rdquo; Laseen roared.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well you shall soon see if there was any arrogance in my action. My sword will soon speak on my behalf.&rdquo; The prince said in a confident tone.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hah! I see now prince. Ever unwavering even in the face of the death. But let&rsquo;s see how you fare when you are but moment from your death!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will be able to know that, since you may soon depart from this world.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;How can someone be so foolish I wonder! Or perhaps it runs in the family. Your father was even more foolish than you. Even after hearing of my suspicious activities multiple times, he still held faith in me. And that faith eventually led to his deep slumber.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Silence, Vizier! No talk of my father. You betrayed his trust. And you shall soon face his wrath from my sword. And how, after maintaining brevity in the royal meetings so long ago have you now turned so loquacious? Are you trying to buy time to escape?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well yes a little bit of that. But anyway time is not a problem. These leaves follow specific patterns. You cannot simply jump from one random leaf to another and reach me. And even a single wrong misstep can entirely annihilate you. So I have no worries. And by the time you figure out the pattern, this cloud shall be in a familiar territory of mine, where magic of my kind looms abound in plenty. And there you shall face my unbound wrath. Only thing that is certain in your future is now your death.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prince thought for a little while. He knew that time was short. Were Laseen to reach the homeland of his magical powers, the prince would be slain with ease. Time was of the essence. Hence he knew he had to find the pattern soon or he would be dead meat.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked around on his leaf and found some stones alongside him. He threw a stone at another leaf. The stone burst into flames, he did this multiple times and was witness to multiple stones bursting into flames. Finally a stone he threw reached another leaf and landed with the thud. He looked at the number on his leaf and the number on the leaf. He was unable to figure out what was the special relation between them.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he looked at the other numbers around them. He could figure out that all numbers were unique. He thought for quite a long while. Time was short on his hands. He had to figure out the pattern soon or he would join his father in the heavens above. Then suddenly, as if struck by lighting, he figured out the solution.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a graph on k nodes, with numbers from b1 to bk written on them. These number bi represent the number present on the leaf while the leaf is the node itself. For every i from 1 to k: find such j (1&le;j&le;k, j&ne;i), for which (bi&oplus;bj) is the smallest among all such j, where &oplus; denotes the operation of bitwise XO. Next, draw an undirected edge between vertices with numbers bi and bj in this graph. The resulting graph is the list of all possible edges and choosing to travel on any nonexistent edge will inevitably lead to death.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He threw a few stones to test his solution and he was in fact right. Now all that was left was to figure out the graph and then reach Laseen. He had a O(n^2) solution, wherein he would find the xor between each pair of numbers and accordingly find the graph. But he knew that would take too much time. And he didn&rsquo;t have enough time. Hence he had to think of a better, faster solution. Something that was around O(n*logn).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought about it hard. For a little while. He tried to recollect his knowledge of xor problems. He could remember using xor tries a lot for xor related problems. After thinking for a while a solution struck him.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Trie Data Structure, you can solve this problem in O(m+n) if we know that values are computer integers (e.g. all 32-bit or 64-bit values).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prince knew that all integers on the leaves are 32-bit values. He used the following steps:</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, Create an empty trie. Every node of trie may contain at most two children for 0 and 1 bits.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Insert all values present on leaves into the tree in O(32&times;n)=O(n).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each value present on the leaf, traverse the tree from the leftmost bit. If a bit doesn't match with child of a middle node, continue the traverse using the existing child until you reach a leaf. Also use a cnt value on the trie so that we don&rsquo;t end up xoring the number with itself. Traversing finishes in O(32&times;n)=O(n)</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which in total, the complexity is O(n+n)=O(n).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This complexity was sufficient enough for him and he was soon able to draw the graph. Then he used dfs to find a way to Laseen. On finding the path he started on the path, hoping to close on Laseen soon.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laseen on seeing the prince approaching him and not being engulfed by the deadly magic on the wrong paths, was shocked to say the least.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;How is this possible!&rdquo; Laseen croaked.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prince soon reached him. &ldquo;And now Vizier, you shall receive the ultimate vengeance, for regicide.&rdquo; He said. Laseen was still in a state of shock and just looked fearfully at the prince.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prince then dismounted his dragon, rushed towards Laseen and finally pierced the tyrant&rsquo;s heart using his sword. Breathing heavily, as Laseen&rsquo;s dead body lay in front of him, tears flowed down his face. He had finally exacted the revenge that he had waited for Seventeen years. With the skies now cleared up, the Prince returned back to the Royal Castle. The battlefield was completely covered in blood, and now most of the enemy soldiers had surrendered to the Prince&rsquo;s army. He got off, and stood on the platform, which was once occupied by his own father to address the country.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the countrymen, all gathered to behold the sight, he shouted, &ldquo;I, Artemus, the King of Malazan swear to bring prosperity and justice to this Kingdom. What Laseen had taken away from this place, I swear to restore unto this land, peace, prosperity, and justice.&rdquo; <br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crowd burst into tears and applause, as after a dark period of seventeen years, the Royal Blood had finally returned to the throne. Moravid and Felisine, both teary-eyed, shouted, &ldquo;Long live the King.&rdquo; which was followed by the chantings by the entire crowd.</span></p>
