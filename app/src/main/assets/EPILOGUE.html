        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new King Artemus, justice and prosperity prevailed in the Kingdom. Slavery had been abolished in the Kingdom, and all the citizens lived their lives freely and happily under this rule. Wherever the eye went, one could see happy children and citizens enjoying their lives. With the support from Hood as the newly appointed Head of the State Magicians, the power of the Nation had also grown substantially. After their battle against their respective foes, and exacting their revenge, Artemus and Felisin had fallen in love with each other. They had a grand marriage, and all of the public had come to witness them taking their vows. All the Vizier&rsquo;s supporters were captured, and the Kingdom had been peaceful for so many years&hellip;.</span></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrations were going on in the Kingdom for the birth of the new Prince. Artemus and his Queen Felisin stood on the platform, with their newborn son, waving at the joyed crowd. In the happy and joyed crowd, however, stood a figure with a face that was fuming with anger. His fists clenched in anger as he could still feel his burning rage towards the Emperor and the fact that while he was tending to his own son, he had taken his father from him. Nineteen years, it had been, but the flame of vengeance inside his heart had never died. Salim Baratheon, the son of Laseen Baratheon at this very moment, swore to destroy the King Artemus.</span></p>
